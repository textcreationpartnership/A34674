            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How well theſe things are here ſpoken unto, I ſhall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave to the godly and learned Readers to judge.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only deſire to give a brief account of the publiſhing of them to the world, that the Reader may undoubtedly aſſure himſelf that theſe are neither ſpurious Copies, nor ſurreptitiouſly put forth.</p>
            <p>The Treatiſe of the <hi>New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> having been taken from
<pb facs="tcp:105680:8"/> the Authors mouth in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was afterward preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with deſire of his peruſal and emendation of it; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done (and indeed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linings of his owne hand doe plainly teſtifie his correcting of it) he delivered back, not long before his death, into the hands of a Gentleman, (one of the Church in <hi>Boſton</hi> there) who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over hither, and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to return, left it with me to take order for the Printing of it.</p>
            <p>That of the <hi>Queries</hi> I had from the Reverend <hi>Author</hi> himſelf (my moſt Honoured friend) in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from him, with liberty (if it might be thought meet) of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of it: At my coming over from that Country (which was about a year before his death) he delivered unto me the ſame for ſubſtance, but in another <hi>Form, viz.</hi> in 12 <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:105680:8"/> therefore did then expreſſe his unwillingneſs to yield to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of them (being moved thereunto by a Reverend Elder then preſent with us) by reaſon (as he ſaid) they were ſet down by way of Propoſitions; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Lord having direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to mould them in to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther model (turning the twelve Propoſitions into eleven Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) he was pleaſed to ſend them over unto me as here they are preſented. He was a man of peace, of a very ſweet ſpirit, and had a ſpeciall faculty of compoſing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the judgements of Brethren: and thus much I ſhall crave liberty to teſtifie of him, that, beſides the multiplicity of occaſions which was conſtantly upon him, he was not without care about the <hi>Peace</hi> and welfare of the Churches abroad; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſo vaſt a diſtance
<pb facs="tcp:105680:9"/> in body from the Churches and Saints in his Native Countrey, yet he had great thoughts of <hi>heart</hi> for the <hi>Diviſion</hi> of his Brethren here, being ſeriouſly ſtudious how to compoſe and heale their breaches: He hath ſometimes ſaid unto me being privately toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<q>Brother I perceive there is a great <hi>gravamen</hi> which the one party is much offended at with the other, I pray let us study how we may eaſe and remove it.</q> From that ſolicitous care it was that he drew up theſe 11 <hi>Queries,</hi> unto which (may it be without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) I ſhall be bold to add one more to make up the number e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and round, the which I doe preſume that our Reverend and honoured friend would not have been averſe unto, had he been on earth, to have been conſulted withall.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:105680:9"/>
            <p>The third and laſt Treatiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>The Reſult of a Synod at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> (as 'tis ſtiled by the Copy come to my hands) was lately ſent over unto me from a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Friend (one that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at that Aſſembly) deſiring mee earneſtly (intimating alſo that 'twas not his owne deſire only) to procure the Printing of it, as conceiving it might prove, very uſefull for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Now theſe three little Treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being in mine hand (through providence) together, and each of them ſomewhat too ſmall to put forth ſeverally, I was the more willing (eſpecially appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending them not to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heterogeniall) to joyne in one ſmall Volume, and as they came from one and the ſame place, ſo to ſend them forth as
<pb facs="tcp:105680:10"/> Companions together: and oh that the preſence and bleſſing of the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may go along with them, making them uſefull and profitable unto the Readers or Hearers of them!</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His bleſſed Servant of God, <hi>Steven,</hi> being called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count concerning what he had ſayd touching Jeſus Chriſt his deſtroying the Temple, it is the ſcope of his whole diſcourſe thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Chapter, to juſtifie the doctrine that he had taught; that though Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſhould deſtroy that place, yet in ſo teaching he taught not blaſphemy. And this he doth (in way
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105680:19"/> of an holy Hiſtory or Narration) make evident in the firſt place from the ſweet communion which their Fathers had with God, before either Temple or Tabernacle was built; and if ſo, then he would not have them look at it as unſafe for them, or as an utter ruine to Religion, if that both the Temple and the Ordinances of the Temple were deſtroyed in themſelves, and fulfilled in him. And firſt, the paſſages of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> communion with God, <hi>Steven</hi> doth relate and maintaine, before any of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Cuſtomes were knowne.</p>
                  <p>God did effectually call him, which call he did alſo obey (<hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4.) though as yet he knew no Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>God giveth him a tryal of his faith, wherein he found <hi>Abraham</hi> faithfull, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7. God promiſed to give him the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> for a poſſeſſion, but he gave him not a foots breadth. He promiſed to give it unto his ſeed, when as yet he had no Child: and when God gave him ſeed, yet they ſhould ſojourn in a ſtrange Land, and be in bondage 400 years.</p>
                  <p>God gave him <hi>the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:105680:19"/> in the words of the Text; and <hi>Abraham</hi> in the ſtrength of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God begate <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed him according to Gods directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all this before <hi>Moſes</hi> gave any Ordinances unto them to keep, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either Temple or Tabernacle was built. From hence we have heard, <hi>That the ſoule may have very ſpirituall and gracious communion with God, before it partake in Church-fellowſhip, or in any Seale thereof;</hi> for <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was throughly tryed, before he had the Seale of Church-Covenant given him. We heard alſo this propounded, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the words of the Text, that <hi>God gave unto Abraham the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion;</hi> which Doctrine doth imply in it four principall parts, all of them ſerving to clear <hi>Stevens</hi> meaning, and to prove his ſcope.

The firſt of them was formerly ſpoken unto in the laſt point formerly handled: Now for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third parts, to wit, the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,</hi> we comprehend them both in this one Note.</p>

                     <label>Doctr.</label> 
                     <hi>That in the Covenant which God made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>he gave himſelfe to be a God to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and to his ſeed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> Abraham <hi>and his ſeed to be a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto himſelfe: and the chiefeſt of this ſeed, the Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>he took to be the Mediator or Surety of this Covenant between them both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the ſum of the Articles, and of the Confederates: What the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles be, is not here mentioned, but <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. they be (for to ſpeak of Circumciſion before a Covenant, it is but a ſeale to a blank) where the Lord expreſſeth himſelfe, thus ſaying, <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me, and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and unto thy ſeed after thee.</hi> As for other parts of the Covenant,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105680:20"/> they were more properly unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelfe, as to be <hi>exceeding fruitfull,</hi> to be <hi>the father of many Nations,</hi> thoſe things were more peculiarly proper unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> though they have a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and univerſall uſe and force in all the faithfull, whom the Lord doth make fruitfull, and giveth them a naile in his Tabernacle. In the Covenant theſe three things are implyed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 God gave himſelfe to be a <hi>God</hi> unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed. This is ſuch an Argument as the ſtrength and wiſdome of men and Angels cannot unfold: It is a Catechiſme point, and by way of Catechiſme to be opened (as the Lord hath revealed it) I mean, plainly and familiarly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 God did receive <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed to be his people, this is implied and neceſſarily inferred by the Rule of Relatives; for if God doe give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a God unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed, and doth not expreſly prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his ſeed, that they ſhould give up themſelves to be his people; then it muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty follow, that the Lord will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to receive them to be a people
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105680:21"/> unto himſelfe, and prevent them in that grace, and ſo he will performe both his owne part of the Covenant, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> part alſo; according to what we read, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6,7,8. when as they were in a Land of Idols, and the Lord lifted up his hand to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them there, yet he remembred and wrought for his own Name ſake: ſo that though they were far off, yet the Lord (to make good his Covenant) brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and ſo from one Covenant to another; by all which things it doth appear, that the Lord will keep our part of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant alſo; and this is neceſſarily implyed, in that he promiſeth to be a God unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed; and there is no expreſſe Reſtipulation pre-required on <hi>Abrahams</hi> part. We ſee this likewiſe held forth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.1.13. where the Lord entreth into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant with them, in the Land of <hi>Moab,</hi> beſides the Covenant which he made with them in <hi>Horeb,</hi> and in this Covenant he doth eſtabliſh them to be a people unto himſelfe, as well as give himſelf to them to be thrir God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. and as God required it of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105680:21"/> them, to circumciſe the outward man, even the foreskin of their Children, ſo he will alſo circumciſe them, taking poſſeſſion of them, and circumciſing their hearts, and taking away the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyneſſe of them, and ſo fit them to be a Temple for himſelfe to dwell in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Lord in this Covenant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the chiefeſt of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, even the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and ſurety of the Covenant, and unto him doe all the Promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: ſo the Apoſtle doth expound it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. — and ſo by him are all the Promiſes and bleſſings of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant conveyed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeed (his faithfull ſeed) all the world over, and therefore he is called the <hi>Mediator of a better Covenant,</hi> Heb. 7.22. meaning of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. Theſe three things doe containe the ſum of the Covenant of Grace, and of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and would therefore be plainly diſcovered unto Chriſtians, as,

                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> given: When God doth by Covenant give himſelf to be a God, it doth imply two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That God doth give Himſelfe, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, the whole Nature of God and all the Perſons: the God-head, with all the Attributes of that Nature, and all the Offices of thoſe perſons; for it is not a confuſed God that vaniſheth away in a generall imagination, but God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly conſidered, in his Perſons, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, Properties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Lord giveth himſelfe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed, <hi>I will be a father unto you,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.18. and that is not ſpoken unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> onely, but unto all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: He giveth the Son alſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. And for the Holy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105680:22"/> Spirit, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16.7.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. <hi>This is my Covenant with them ſaith the Lord, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words that I have put into thy mouth ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> &amp;c. And this is it which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alſo ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. Thus the Lord giveth himſelfe unto his Servants from one Generation to another. If therefore the Lord, God the Father give himſelfe, he will not be wanting to draw his people unto the Son, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.44. and what is the chief buſineſſe and work that the Son hath to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us? No man can have fellowſhip with the Father, but he muſt have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelfe ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>No man can come unto the Father, but by me:</hi> This therefore the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will doe for all the elect ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he will open their eyes to ſee, that the Father did not draw them to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or utter deſolation (though at firſt that be their greateſt fear) but unto ſalvation by him. This hath he promiſed to doe, and if it be the work of the Spirit of God to eſtabliſh us both in the Father and the Son, then will he <hi>convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105680:23"/> and of judgement,</hi> John 16.8, to 11. and ſo will eſtabliſh our hearts in the comforts of the Lord our God; and this is that which the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Chap. 3.16. Hence it cometh to paſſe, that what the Lord would have us to doe, he is preſent by his Spirit to teach us, and to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us, and ſo to doe it for us. All theſe things doth the Lord work for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and for his Elect ſeed: So that look what is meet for a Father to do, or for a Brother to doe, or for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to doe, that will the Lord doe unto his elect ones; and ſo he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all his attributes, and they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven God himſelfe; and therefore when <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee his glory, and he deſired it from the grace that God had ſhewed him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6. the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed his Name before him, <hi>Jehovah, Jehovah, ſtrong, mercifull, and gracious,</hi> &amp;c. Thus doth the Lord give himſelfe, and all the Perſons in the God-head (as they are truly called) and Attributes, they are no more, nor no other then God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 And as God himſelf is implyed; ſo when God is given by Covenant, all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105680:23"/> the Ordinances and Creatures, and works of God are given alſo, for ſo it was in all Covenants of old time; when <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> maketh a Covenant with <hi>Ahab</hi> King of Iſrael, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.4. then <hi>I am as thou art, and my people as thy people, and my Horſes as thy Horſes,</hi> and all that he hath is for <hi>Ahabs</hi> ſervice, as the King goeth, ſo goeth his ſtrength; ſo thus it comes to paſſe, that if the Lord of Hoaſts be for us, and give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us, then alſo he gives unto us his Eternall <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> and whatſoever he hath wrought for the ſalvation of his Elect; He hath not ſo dealt with any Nation (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.20.) but only with the Iſrael of God, unto them hath he given his Laws and ſhewed them his judgements: And for his <hi>Creatures,</hi> they are all given to be for his People, to whom he hath given himſelf. If God be a God unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> then ſhall all Gods people be for him, <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> ſhall bleſſe him, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Eſhcot,</hi> and <hi>Mamre,</hi> ſhall be Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates with him; the Sun, Moon, and Stars ſhall fight in their courſes for the people of God; the Sea ſhall give way to paſſe through it on dry ground,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105680:24"/>

                     </gap> he is in Covenant with them. This is that which the Lord promiſeth unto his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. to 22. when the Lord ſhall marry them to him in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. This is the large gift of Gods Covenant. Nay, and which is wonderfull and beyond all comprehenſion, when I ſay, all the Creatures and Ordinances of God are ours, the very expreſſion of the phraſe doth imply that the Lord giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the ſtaffe and ſtrength of them; ſo that you ſhall ſee the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in them, he will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give a man wife and children, and Ordinances, and providences, but he will be in all theſe, and bleſſe his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the enjoyment of them all, ſo as that they ſhall enjoy God in all. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.5,6. <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance.</hi> He ſaw the Lord in what he did enjoy, and when he had any thing it was in God, &amp; when he wanted any thing it was ſupplyed in him. The like did <hi>Jacob</hi> find, when his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> came againſt him with 400 men, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105680:24"/> the Lord turned him from the fierce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe of his wrath; here was the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Lord gave him the mouth, and arms, and tears of his brother <hi>Eſau:</hi> what ſaith <hi>Jacob</hi> to all this? <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.10. <hi>I have ſeen thy face as though I had ſeen the face of God.</hi> He ſaw the power and mercy of God in changing the countenance of his elder brother: and that is it which ſweetneth all that a man doth enjoy, the loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnes of God in all, is the bleſſing of all; and this likewiſe doth <hi>Jacob</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.5. <hi>Theſe are the Children which God hath gratiouſly given thy Servant;</hi> and ſo he looked at them as Gods wives, and children, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Cattell; and this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life of the Covenant of Grace, when as the Lord is wrapped up in all his bleſſings, when as he giveth himſelfe, and in himſelfe his Chriſt, &amp; in Chriſt <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and all things unto his Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22,23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 32. This is the maine thing given, God himſelfe, the God of the Covenant, his Perſons, Nature, Ordinances, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and now <hi>Abraham</hi> is made the Lord of the world: and ſo the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105680:25"/> doth interpret it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. the <hi>Promiſe that he ſhould be Heire of the world,</hi> &amp;c. and this is that which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did receive in receiving the Lord to be his God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>2</label> In the <hi>Order</hi> of giving the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, there is ſomething to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 God giveth firſt, and not the Creature, it was not <hi>Abraham</hi> that gave unto God firſt, for which of all the Creatures ſhall offer a Covenant unto the Mighty God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. the Lord hath the preheminence in giving, for what ſhould <hi>Abraham</hi> give unto God, if God give not ſomething unto him firſt? He is the firſt giver.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He is alſo the firſt thing in order that is given; for, doth he give the world firſt, or Ordinances firſt? or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſpirituall or temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings firſt? No doubtleſſe, the Lord is the firſt thing that he giveth by his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and with himſelfe all things elſe alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. And there is the precedency of Jeſus Chriſt, he is given, and in him all ſpirituall bleſſings, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. and this for the order of Nature in giving the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105680:25"/> Covenant: not Obedience firſt, nor Faith firſt, nor any thing elſe firſt, but himſelfe is <hi>Donum primum &amp; primarium,</hi> and in him, all his goodneſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>3</label> For the <hi>Manner</hi> of giving; in that he giveth himſelfe, there is implyed both the freedome and eternity of the gift, firmneſſe therefore and that unto eternity. In that he giveth himſelfe, it muſt of neceſſity be done freely; for what can any Creature give to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe God? If a man could give thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of worlds they were not enough to purchaſe or redeem one ſoule; and if he had millions of worlds to give, what were they all to purchaſe ſo great a gift as God himſelfe is? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be of free gift, for the Creature can doe nothing to prevent God. God indeed may give with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to receive back againe, as God doth require this of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould have no other Gods before him, <hi>&amp;c. Gen.</hi> 17.1. But though <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall performe this and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements in an Evangelicall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet God himſelfe doth undertake in this Covenant to be the Author and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105680:26"/> finiſher of this his faith and obedience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. And this doth argue the marvelous freedome of the Covenant of Grace, for the Lord offereth it out of his grace without the foreſight of faith or works, for he undertaketh to give both will and deed of his good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 By a Spirit of <hi>Bondage,</hi> whereby he cutteth off the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from all worldly intanglements and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights; thus God took <hi>Abraham,</hi> and brought him from beyond the Flood, and ſo doth he take men off from their Countreys and Fathers houſes, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates them from all ſuch things that he might draw them unto himſelfe: Thus he dealt with the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and called them to be a ſingular people unto himſelfe, and yet but in a Covenant of works, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6,7,8. Thus doth the Lord deale with all thoſe whom he receiveth to be a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto himſelf; and by this ſpirit of bondage he draweth them from all their ſinfull luſts and paſſions, ſo as that they can find no hope of mercy in any thing; and this is properly a Seal of the Covenant of works, as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption is a ſeale of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. Now by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105680:28"/> this bondage the Lord firſt ſetteth home unto the Conſciences of men the weight and danger of their ſins, and it is the uſuall manner of God to give a Covenant of Grace by leading men firſt into a Covenant of works (as it is his conſtant manner to work by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) and ſo to thruſt men out of doors that they may have fellowſhip with himſelfe at length; I had a gratious father (will the poor ſoule ſay) but now I may goe and ſhake my ears like a poor wretch) for ſo indeed he is caſt out of the Covenant and favour of God to his ſenſe and feeling; but thus the Lord doth even ſhut him out of doors, that he may open to him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a better way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Lord alſo Prepareth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by a Spirit of <hi>Burning,</hi> which upon a ſpirit of bondage he doth ſhed abroad into the hearts of men: This we read of, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. It is ſpoken of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> which did burn like an oven againſt all the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and left them neither the root of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Covenant, nor the branch of their own good works: he cutteth them off from the Covenant
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105680:29"/> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Mat. 3.9. <hi>Think not to ſay that you have</hi> Abraham <hi>to be your father,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo by cutting them off from the root, he leaveth them no ground to truſt on. From their good works the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alſo cutteth them off, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2.5.16. This was a Spirit of <hi>Burning,</hi> which the Lord conveyed by the M niſtry of Chriſt and of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> to burn up all the Hypocrites like ſtubble, and the beauty of their works was blaſted by it; and this is Gods uſuall manner of dealing. Now there are many under a Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, that never came under a Spirit of burning; yet many under a Spirit of bondage doe fear the Lord with ſome kind of reverence unto his Ordinances; for as an Angel of God they received <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet, for many of them, they were but under the Law, and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He is afraid of them leaſt he hath beſtowed his labour in vaine,</hi> Gal. 4.9,10,11. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 21. where he ſaith, <hi>Tell me ye that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. A ſigne that this bondage under which they were, did not onely bind them under fear of wrath, but did bind them alſo to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105680:29"/> the Ordinances of God with ſome kind of devout reverence: Now you have many men that reſt there, but when the Lord doth carry men fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then he ſendeth a ſpirit of <hi>burning,</hi> thereby to blaſt all the fruits and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their righteouſneſſe, and to burn up all, that under a Covenant of works a man hath wrought; and this is that which the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.4. that <hi>the Lord will purge away the filth of the daughter of Sion with a ſpirit of judgement and of burning.</hi> The one is a ſpirit of ſanctification, and the other is a conſuming fire, which force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them not to build any comfort upon any works that they have done. This may Hypocrites reach unto in their judgements, ſo as that they may be convinced, that they have neither root within them, nor branch growing upon them, and yet in the mean while they may not come unto a Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, but hereby alſo the Lord u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to prepare his people. Some bleſſe themſelves in worldly courſes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come unto a ſpirit of <hi>bondage:</hi> ſome doe find comfort in their performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and never ſaw the vanity of their

                  <p>Look as in a mans firſt naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as ſoon as ever <hi>Adam</hi> doth live, there is an heir of <hi>Adam,</hi> even ſo ſoon as the ſoul liveth: So it is in this new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall birth, as ſoon as the Holy Ghoſt cometh and hath wrought this faith, now is the ſeed of God in us, and the life of Chriſt, and the Spirit of God, and now are we the Sons of God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.12.

And here is the Root of all the life and power of this Mediation, to wit, this perſonall Union betweene Jeſus Chriſt and the Father, which maketh up a firm and everlaſting communion between God himſelfe, and Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by Gods giving him to be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105680:36"/> a Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant of the people,</hi> &amp;c. That is, to be a Mediator of this Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To receive from God all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and gratious gifts, whatſoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to a King, Prieſt, and Prophet, all things he receiveth from the hand of the Father, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fullneſſe dwell,</hi> thus he becometh a plentifull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: And as the Lord gave him to be a Covenant, ſo he giveth him alſo to worke all things needfull for our Redemption: partly by his Paſſion, and obedience unto the death of the Croſs, and partly by fulfilling the whole Law, all righteouſneſſe for us. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt did fully accompliſh what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was requiſite for him to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh in his owne Perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 He doth perform all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Application of this redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto our ſoules; and to this end, he it is that ſheddeth abroad his Spirit into our hearts, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. &amp; 16.7. and when this bleſſed Spirit cometh, he applyeth unto the ſoule all the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious redemption of Jeſus Chriſt, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him and all the fruits of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:105680:37"/> and by working all thoſe bleſſed works that the ſouls of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come to be partakers of; and ſo performeth all thoſe Conditions that are required on our parts: If it be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for us to have faith, he will work it in us: If it be needfull for us to live a life of Faith, he will help us ſo to live, for it is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.9. Thus hath the Lord made him a compleat Mediatour of this holy Covenant, and whatſoever we receive, we receive it from him; for unto him firſt as the head of the Church are all bleſſings given, and unto us <hi>all Promiſes in him are Yea and in him Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. for though Chriſt be not a ſinner in his owne perſons, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his Members, he is many times loſt in them, though not in himſelfe; and poor in them, though not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for us therefore he receiveth the Promiſes of God, and that is the great ſecurity of them, that they are laid up ſafe in him, and belong unto us if we have Union with the head; and in him we perform whatſoever God requireth, whether we Pray, or Preach, or hear, we doe all in the Name of Chriſt, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105680:37"/> forth in his ſtrength and power, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. Thus is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt a firm Surety of the better Covenant, <hi>Stabliſhed upon better Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 1.</label> In the firſt place, This may teach us a broad difference between the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works and the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>In the Covenant of works, the Lord offereth himſelfe as a Father, his Son as a Redeemer, his Spirit as a Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but this upon a condition of works, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me;</hi> and <hi>If they ſhall keep his Lawes and obey his voyce, then they ſhall be a peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unto him above all people,</hi> Exod. 19.5,6. This alſo they undertake to doe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. <hi>All that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, we will heare it and doe it; But O that there were ſuch an heart in them,</hi> verſ. 29. When they rebelled, he did not pardon them gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly; but the Angel whom he ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with them he biddeth them beware of him, and obey his voyce and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him not, <hi>For he will not pardon your Tranſgreſſions for my Name is in him;</hi> In the Covenant of Grace he will, but not in this; here is indeed a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105680:38"/> Redeemer and Saviour, and ſo it is expreſſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.8,9,10. — with many of them God was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, almoſt with none of them, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew them in the wilderneſs. Thus in the Covenant of works all is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon condition of obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Lord giving Himſelf, his Son, his Spirit upon condition, though it be but to works, yet he is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into ſome kind of relative Union, expreſſed <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.32. <hi>Which my Covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them.</hi> He was marryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in Church-Covenant, this was ſome kind of Union, he was their God and they were his peculiar people, and yet the Lord caſt them off (a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wrath) from this Marriage Covenant between them and him: from this Union there ſpringeth a kind of Faith, by which the ſoule cleaveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord in ſome meaſure, elſe there could not be this marriage union; and this faith is that which you read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12,13. <hi>They beleeved his words, they ſang his praiſe,</hi> &amp;c. So alſo <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.31. it is ſaid, <hi>They beleeved the Lord and his ſervant Moſes.</hi> This is that faith
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:105680:38"/> which men may receive, and yet may Apoſtate from it, ſpoken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.3. to 6. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.13. but all that faith was never grounded upon any free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace, but all was built upon Ordinances and Duties, and upon no higher ground. In the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.8. to 12. marvelouſly ſtrong are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>Abijah</hi> when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> came againſt him, <hi>You think to withſtand the Kingdome of the Lord in the hand of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> &amp;c. Where we ſee what faith he did expreſſe, and hereupon (<hi>verſ.</hi> 18.) <hi>The Children of Iſrael were brought under, and the Children of Judah prevailed;</hi> and yet this Kings heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.3. and yet (mind you) <hi>a ſtrong confidence he had that the Lord was with him, and that he would be preſent with his owne Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;</hi> there was faith built upon fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with Ordinances, like unto that Faith in the Scripture before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. Men are affected with the word, and beleeve and find comfort, and all this ſpringeth from that Relative Communion which they have with the Lord, they find refreſhing in their way and work, and many times
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105680:39"/> take it for the very Seale of the Spirit of God. All which may and oftentimes is found in Hypocrites; but here's the difference, in a Covenant of workes God giveth himſelfe Conditionally; in that of grace, Abſolutely; in both he maketh a Covenant, in the one of Grace, the other of works, in which the Voyce of the Lord is, <hi>If you be true and faithfull to me, then I will not remove you,</hi> and in this Covenant is Faith found, whereby they lay hold upon the head of the Sacrifice, but not on Chriſt: it is onely built upon ſuch changes as they finde in themſelves, and will in the end vaniſh utterly away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There is a difference alſo that ſpringeth from the fruits of theſe two Covenants i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> their continuance; for tho in the Covenant of works there be a ſemblance of <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and a kind of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> yet they endure but for a ſeaſon, and therefore he calleth them <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> for ye are not my people, and <hi>Lo-ruhamah,</hi> for I will no more have mercy, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were his people, and he then had mercy on them: They may alſo have pardon of ſin, that is forbearance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105680:39"/> of puniſhment for a ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.37,38. <hi>Being full of compaſſion he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not,</hi> yet they were ſuch <hi>whoſe heart was not upright with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</hi> This is plainly held forth in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.23. to the end. When the Servant had not wherewith to pay his Lord, he fell down and worſhipped him, ſaying, <hi>Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all,</hi> his Lord was moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and looſed him &amp; forgave him the debt, but when he had not like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on his fellow-ſervant, then his Lord was wroth and charged all his iniquities upon him, and caſt him into priſon, untill he ſhould pay all that was due to him. So that the Pardon is not everlaſting, but onely reſpite from outward puniſhment, and from inward pangs of Conſcience many times, and this they take for pardon of ſin, and acceptance with Jeſus Chriſt, when indeed they are deluded. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ther <hi>Sanctification</hi> is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they come at laſt to <hi>tread under foot the blood of the Covenant wherewith they were ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.29. for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105680:40"/> Chriſt was but a Conditionall Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unto them; they had onely gifts of Tongues, and utterance, and wiſdome, and diſcerning of ſpirits, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith; which things are not that Sanctification which is a fruit of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith, but onely ſuch gifts as doe ſanctifie them unto the work of the Miniſtry perhaps, or Magiſtracy, and fit them for houſhold Government, or the like; and ſo much Poſitive work there is in them as doth make them in ſome meaſure fit for the work or ſervice they are called unto.</p>
                  <p>For a little more explaining of this, Is it the ſame with that Sanctification which is in Gods Children? God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. All the men in the world are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into two ranks, Godly or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, Righteous or Wicked; of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men two ſorts, ſome are notoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, others are Hopocrites: Of Hypocrites two ſorts (and you ſhall find them in the Church of God) ſome are waſhed Swine, others are Goats.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The <hi>Swine</hi> are thoſe of whom our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That they returne unto their wallowing in the mire;</hi> like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe are ſuch men who at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105680:40"/> of ſome Sermon have been ſtomach ſick of their ſins, and have rejected their wicked courſes, but yet the ſwines heart remaineth in them, as a Swine when he cometh where the puddle is, will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily lye down in it: ſo will theſe men wallow in the puddle of uncleanneſſe when their conſcience is not pricked for the preſent: But theſe are a groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer kind of Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is another ſort that goe far beyond theſe, and they are <hi>Goats,</hi> ſo called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.32,33. and theſe are clean Beaſts ſuch as chew the cudd, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon Ordinances, and they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the hoofe, they live both in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and particular calling, and will not be idle; they are alſo fit for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; what then is wanting? Truly they are not <hi>ſheep</hi> all this while, they are but <hi>Goats,</hi> yet a Goat doth loath that which a Swine will readily break into; but where then doe they fall ſhort of the nature of ſheep? A diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is, which ſtandeth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Goat is of a Capricious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and affecteth Eminency, his gate alſo is ſtately, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.30. <hi>Agur</hi> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105680:41"/> the He-goat among the 4 things that are comely in going: And they are full of Ambition, they cannot abide ſwamps and holes, but will be climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the tops of mountains; there is not that plain lowly ſheepiſh frame that attendeth unto the voyce of the Shepheard, to be led up and downe in freſh paſtures: they attend upon their ends, and will outſhoot God in his own Bowe, and therefore when they have done many things for Chriſt, he will ſay unto them, <hi>Depart from me, ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity.</hi> More Eminency they did affect, then they were guided unto. Thus it was with <hi>Jehu,</hi> who in his zeal for God thought to promote himſelfe, and herein he will not be perſwaded of his ſin, and therefore going into crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wayes, he cometh at length to cleave unto the ſins of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, you may recrive a Goat into Church-fellowſhip for all his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious nature, and he will be a clean creature, and of much good uſe. The five fooliſh <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.2. were all of them <hi>Virgins,</hi> all of them abhorring Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all go forth to meet the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105680:41"/> and yet they are fooliſh and never ſhall you make them wiſe, to be all for Chriſt, onely hearing and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his voyce.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They are of a Rankiſh nature all of them, ſpecially the old Goats will have an unſavory reliſh, far from that pleaſant ſweetneſſe that is in a ſheep; and herein Hypocrites are greatly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the ſheep of Chriſt, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.21, and they marre the Paſtures with their feet, and will be at length mudling the faire waters of the Sanctuary alſo; and in your beſt ſanctification they fall far ſhort of a ſheep-like frame of ſpirit, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to heare the voyce of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheard, this will not be found in the ſanctification of the beſt Hypocrite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, they may goe far and yet fall away, and this is no Arminianiſm, but if you ſearch the Scriptures dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, you will find theſe things to be true.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 There is a fourth difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covenant of works and of grace, in reſpect of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> Gal 3.19. <hi>The Law was given and ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediatour. Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:105680:42"/> was a Mediatour according to the works, and this our Saviour telleth the Jewes, <hi>John</hi> 5.45. <hi>You have one that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth you, even Moſes in whom ye truſt:</hi> And as for Jeſus Chriſt, if he be given to be their Redeemer, it is but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their works, if they ſhall obey his voyce, but if they ſhall ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he will overthrow them body and ſoule into the nethermoſt Hell. But now in the Covenant of Grace, Jeſus Chriſt hath <hi>Obtained a more excellent Miniſtry, to be the Mediator of a better Covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> Heb. 8.6. Thus we ſee in this firſt Uſe, the difference between the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and the Covenant of Grace.</p>

                     <label>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 2.</label> I might alſo here (in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place) from hence gather an Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole body of Arminianiſm, for they look at no gift of God, but meerly upon the faith or works of the Creature foreſeen: If God ſpeake of Election or any other gift of his grace, they tell you it is of Faith foreſeen: but we ſee how contrary it is unto this truth of God, for he giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe firſt in order of nature, before he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105680:42"/> giveth any thing elſe accompanying Salvation. He gave us Chriſt in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Counſel before Election, and ſo doth he alſo in our Effectuall Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; not any Grace before Chriſt, or power to chooſe whether we will have him or not have him: but he is God, and firſt giveth himſelfe, and with him faith, and ſo worketh our wills unto himſelfe; not otherwiſe, leaving it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us to chooſe whether we will have him to be our God or no. Many things in Popery and Arminianiſme come to be conſuted from hence, and both are utterly rooted out; for in truth they hold forth no more but a Covenant of works: And if we will not grant faith to be the cauſe of all the bleſſed gifts of God, they will take it marvelouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, but they were as good deliver unto us another Goſpel; for it is not of Grace, that Faith is given us?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe 3.</label> This may alſo teach the people of God, to bear a gratious reſpect unto thoſe that are under a Covenant of works, and not forthwith to condemn them, as if there were no hope of their Salvation: For God doth not call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into fellowſhip with himſelfe in a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105680:43"/> Covenant of Grace, but ordinarily he firſt bringeth them into a Covenant of works, and caſteth them out of doors by a ſpirit of bondage and of burning, and then bringeth them in by the true door, and Jeſus Chriſt is that doore, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.9. Though the Children of the Faithfull be born under the outward diſpenſation of the Covenant of Grace, yet if they be not of the Elect ſeed, they will choſe life by their works, and ſo fall under the Covenant of works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24. to 30. So will Profeſſors alſo, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. yea, the Elect themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Effectuall Calling, will ſeek life by their works. Hence thoſe that are under a Covenant of works may belong unto the Lord as well as my ſelfe, pray for them therefore. <hi>Paul</hi> was under a Covenant of workes, <hi>Steven</hi> prayeth for him, and as moſt conceive, that Prayer was effectuall unto his Converſion, and <hi>Paul</hi> was as dear unto the Lord in his Eternall purpoſe, as <hi>Steven</hi> himſelfe was: And thus <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe ſpeaketh of <hi>Oneſimus, He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore departed for a ſeaſon that he might be received for ever:</hi> So may we ſay of men under a Covenant of works, the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105680:43"/> Lord may bring any of them home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe by daſhing all his works in pieces, and ſhewing him the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Spirit, though the Lord hath melted him formerly in his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Preachings, and Hearing, and Sacraments, by a Spirit of burning; yet the Lord will diſcover that he is but hardened by it into another lump of pride againſt the Lord his God: And the Lord will alſo pluck away the caul from their hearts, and then they will have none in Heaven but Chriſt, nor in the earth in compariſon of him, and then the Holy Ghoſt convinceth them of this ſin above all their other ſins, that they have not believed on Jeſus Chriſt. Doe not therefore cenſure any ſuch, as to ſay there is no likelihood that they ſhould have fellowſhip with Chriſt, for if the Lord make them to fall down before him, and to yield up their ſpirits unto the Lord in holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and feare, theſe have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome ſecret ſmoking affections (beſides a Spirit of burning) which the Lord will not quench.</p>

If the Lord doe give any ſaving Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before Chriſt, then the ſoule may be in a ſtate of Salvation before Chriſt, and that would be prejudiciall unto the grace and truth of Chriſt; for if there be no name given under Heaven whereby we muſt be ſaved, but onely Jeſus Chriſt, nor his name, but in a way of fellowſhip with him, then it will unavoidably follow, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſaving work there be in the ſoul, it is not there before Chriſt be there; it is true, <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was ſent to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all fleſh by a ſpirit of burning, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> burneth up the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> I mean their carnall confidence in it, and all their fruits of righteouſneſſe; here were indeed preparations for

                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> We know the Lord can convey him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in an Evangelicall Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as in a Promiſe, as we find it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.14. <hi>Feare thou not worme</hi> Jacob, <hi>I will help thee,</hi> &amp;c. He can alſo convey himſelfe in a threatning to the Devill, as unto our firſt Parents he did convey himſelfe, wrapping up a Promiſe in it, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. from whence the Lord gave them to ſuck a ſweet and comfortable Promiſe of his free grace: And when the like is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in a Commandment, the Lord undertaketh to work that which he ſo commandeth.</p>
                  <p>But now it is queſtioned, <hi>Whether the Promiſe wherein the Lord giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, be Abſolute or Conditionall?</hi> Faith to receive Chriſt is ever upon an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Promiſe, if you will ſay it is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to a Condition, what kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was it? there is no Condition before Faith, but a conditon of miſery, a loſt condition, or if a gratious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it is a Condition ſubſequent, not prae-exiſtent, no Condition before
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105680:46"/> it, whereby a man can cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt: and if it was a Condition after Faith, unto which the Promiſe was made, then faith was there before, and whatſoever followeth Converſion, is no ground of Faith, but a fruit and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it; therefore I ſay our firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on to Chriſt cannot be upon a Conditionall but upon an Abſolute Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>And if ever the Lord miniſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto any man, true comfort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good grounds is ever built upon a Promiſe of free grace.

                  <p>There is a fourth Queſtion which is as a further branch of this fourth Uſe, which I would not ſpeak to, but that I might through the good hand of God, the better clear things, that we may not ſtumble in our expreſſions in

                     <label>Queſt. 4.</label> Now foraſmuch as you heare of a Sanctification under a Covenant of works, it doth imply that there is a Sanctification that is but tranſitory, and not everlaſting, nor immortall: <hi>Whether then may a man evidence his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

                  <p>
                     <label>Prop. 1.</label> That a Sanctification, which the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Law may produce (that is to ſay, ſuch a Sanctification as may be found in a Covenant of works) is no evidence or witneſſe of our union with Chriſt. And I ſuppoſe there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there; but though there be no difference in mens judgements in this,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105680:47"/> yet it is an eaſie thing for Chriſtians to abuſe their Evidence upon this very ground, and as much upon this ground as upon any: For when Chriſtians come to be really wrought upon, and find themſelves diſcouraged from ſin, and ſo reforme their lives and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to obey the word, and find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort therein (and great conſolation many times) in ſuch a caſe as this, Chriſtians doe much differ upon the point; yet I doe not know any of all the Teachers in the Country, that withdraw their conſents from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that ſuch Sanctification, as is wrought in Hypocrites, though it may reach to great improvements, yet it is no evidence of Juſtification at all. And it hath been handled in another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and I thinke not without weight of truth; that to diſtinguiſh in men between that Sanctification which floweth from the Law, and that which is of the Goſpel, is a matter ſo narrow, that the Angels in Heaven have much adoe to diſcern who differ: a work fitter for Angels to cut the ſcantling in it, then for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, though indeed there be great difference
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105680:48"/> of the one from the other. Now though this doe not tend to heale any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in judgement, yet it is uſefull to heale a miſpriſion of ſanctification that may be found in all Hypocrites of this Country, and elſwhere.</p>
                  <p>Three things are to be attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in all ſanctification.
<list>
                        <item>1 From what Root it ſpringeth.</item>
                        <item>2 By what Rule it is guided.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>And commonly under one or other of theſe three, are put all the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces between the one ſanctification and the other.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak it that it may be ſearched, and (God is my witneſſe) not to unſettle the well-grounded comfort of any ſoule; but if any have built upon an unſafe ground, or have built Hay or ſtubble, better it is to know it at firſt, whilſt there is hope in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> than when it is too late.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe three things formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are all the differences between the ſanctification of Hypocrites, and of the Children of God, and they goe ſo cloſe together, that you will ſay it is an eaſie matter to diſcerne juſtification by ſanctification.</p>

                     <label>1</label> For the Root of it, the ſoule ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fellowſhip with Chriſt, the Holy Ghoſt cometh into the ſoule, &amp; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and this is the root of all Chriſtian ſanctification, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. and for Faith, it is that which <hi>purifieth the heart,</hi> Acts 15.9. &amp; <hi>without faith it is impeſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> Heb. 11.6. So that Faith muſt concur unto the rootedneſſe of our ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt: And the Apoſtle doth attribute both theſe Roots unto both ſorts: Unto thoſe Chriſtians that ſhall afterwards fall away to ſin the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>They have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Gift was Faith, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reckoneth chiefly among the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Religion, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. A taſt they had both of Faith and the Holy Ghoſt, yet from both theſe they fall away.</p>
                  <p>You know what was ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.10. <hi>The Spirit of God came upon him,</hi> and ſo did it likewiſe upon <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> acting them mightily in their Adminiſtrations; and as they were thus carryed along by the Spirit,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:105680:49"/> ſo likewiſe the ſpirit of bondage will marvelouſly prevaile with the Sons of men to draw them on to ſtrong works of Reformation, from whence they reap no ſmall Conſolation, but think and ſay (as <hi>Abijah</hi> did) that <hi>the Lord is with them whilſt they are with him:</hi> And as ſometimes <hi>David</hi> ſaid of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>I believed, therefore I ſpake,</hi> ſo the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> alſo (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12.) <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſang the praiſes of the Lord upon the red ſea ſhore,</hi> and yet were they but an Hypocriticall Generation; and if Hypocrites may work Miracles in the name of Chriſt (as they did, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate with Chriſt about it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22.) then may a temporary Faith work or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary works in Chriſtianity alſo: and therefore you ſhall read (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.22.) that there is no fault found with the thorny ſoile for their want of root, or depth of earth, for the want of both which the ſtony ſoile was taxed; but look as it is with the branches of a Vine, what depth of earth the roote hath, they have, it being grafted into the Vine though they be but branches of the wild Olive, and will bring forth but wild fruit; for though the branch
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105680:49"/> of the wild Olive be grafted into the fat Olive, and may flouriſh there, yet will it bring forth his owne fruit, but in the roote you will finde no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And yet there is a difference, but it is very hard to be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Object.</label> Yes (you will ſay) there is a plaine difference, for an hypocrite is ever full of himſelfe, but a true Chriſtian doth all in faith, he ſeeketh God daily, and waiteth upon God daily, and theſe are not the wayes of hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> Conſider (I pray you) what the Word of the Lord holdeth forth as the Roote of this ſanctification, and I will go no further than expreſſe Scriptures. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2. <hi>They ſeeke me daily;</hi> and this is ſpoken of hypocriticall <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and for <hi>waiting,</hi> we often heare it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the five fooliſh Virgins, that they all went out to meet the bridegroome, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.1. though while they tarryed long, <hi>they all ſlumbred and ſlept,</hi> and ſo did the wiſe Virgins alſo; and for more particular application of God unto themſelves, we finde that alſo <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall cry unto me, <hi>My God, we know thee;</hi> and yet this <hi>Iſrael</hi> (in the ſame Scripture) had <hi>tranſgreſſed the Covenant,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105680:50"/> and caſt off the thing that is good.</hi> And for a further Act of faith, which is a ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mans ſelfe upon God, what ſaith the Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.2. <hi>They ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael;</hi> and theſe were obſtinate ſinners, and their neck as an iron ſinew, and their brow as braſſe: there was not truth and uprightneſſe; True it was not, but how ſhall we know the difference? Truly it is hard to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive when men differ, and therefore it is not an eaſie matter to make ſuch uſe of Sanctification, as by it to beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto Juſtification: and it will be a very hard caſe and much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, when men cannot feele the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſpirituall gifts, but want ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall light: and when they doe finde faith in themſelves, they doe finde it in hypocrites alſo, even in hypocrites al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, even faith to ſeeke the Lord, &amp; faith to waite upon him, and faith to apply him, ſaying, <hi>My God,</hi> and faith to ſtay upon the <hi>God of Iſrael;</hi> and yet theſe men doe vaniſh away in hypocriſie; this hypocrites may doe; ſeeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what eaſines of errour may befall Chriſtians, whether this or that grace be of the right ſtampe or no, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105680:50"/> Chriſtians to be wary, for even Eagle-eyed Chriſtians will have much adoe ſo to diſcerne of ſanctification in themſelves, before they ſee their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as to cut off all hypocrites from having the like in them, for the ſanctified frame of Gods children, and that which ſeemeth to be like it in hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, both of them ſpring from the holy Ghoſt, and both from faith: but now the Spirit of God hath further worke in his own people, beyond what he worketh upon others, though he melteth both, yet hypocrites are melted as iron, which will returne againe to his former hardnes, but his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are melted into fleſh, which will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returne to his hardnes more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they reſt in any meaſure of ſoftnes unto which they have attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but ſtill are carryed toward Jeſus Chriſt: ſo that the one is a temporary faith, and the other perſevereth; though both worke in the name of Chriſt, yet this difference will be found between them, not only when hypocrites come to be blaſted, but even in the midden of their profeſſion: As for the faith of the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, it is never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105680:51"/> of its own power, but his ſtrength lyeth out of himſelfe in Chriſt; whereas hypocrites and legall Chriſtians are confident of their faith, that they can make uſe of it unto ſuch and ſuch ends, they think they need no more but look up to Chriſt, and their worke is at an end; and ſuch ſtrength they finde in themſelves, as that they doe not feare, but that they ſhall carry an end all their worke to Gods glory and their own: whereas the ſtrongeſt faith even of the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> (whoſe faith was ſuch, as none of all the Churches went before them) if it be not ſupplyed and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, they know, &amp; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> knoweth that it will warpe &amp; ſhrinke. This may we ſee by comparing, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.2,10. And the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Him to <hi>worke all their works for them.</hi> And therefore as there is a reall difference in the preſence of the Spirit; ſo alſo in the worke of faith in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and the children of God, for the one putteth confidences in himſelfe in the gift received, and the other in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi> This is the firſt difference of Sanctification.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:105680:51"/>
                  <p>
                     <label>2.</label> There is Difference alſo in the Rule whereby they are guided, though both ſeeke to the word of God &amp; take delight in that, inſomuch as you ſhall not be able to difference them there, yet a great difference there is in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the word: the one is ſo conſident of the comfort that he hath in the word, and he will be ready to take it ill at Gods hand, if he finde not acceptance before him: Now the other ſee the need they have of the Lord to maintaine their comfort for them. This manner of affection we finde in <hi>David,</hi> when the Lord had brought him and his people into a ſweet frame and temper of ſpirit to offer willingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the building of the Temple; what ſaith <hi>David</hi> now? Doth he thinke this to be enough? No, no, but he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>O Lord God of Abraham, Iſaack, and Iſrael our fathers keepe this for ever in the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thoughts of the heart of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and prepare their heart unto thee.</hi> Thus is he ſenſible that theſe comforts would ſoone faile them, &amp; they ſhould againe waxe barren and uncomfortable. And here is the nature of true Conſolation
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105680:52"/> in Chriſt, to looke up unto the Lord to preſerve and maintaine it, and ſo he is ſtill drawne neerer &amp; neerer to Chriſt. But now though both attend unto the Word, as their Rule of Sanctification, if you take it in the way, in which the one and the other hold it forth, yet there is a great difference. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed,</hi> &amp;c. Here is a Rule; what, may not hypocrites walke according to this rule? Truly they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe no leſſe, and they think it enough, if they have but a Rule in their eye, and therfore under a ſpirit of bondage they are confident and ſay, <hi>Whatſoever the Lord commandeth us, we will heare it and doe it,</hi> Deut. 5.27. And what ſaith <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam; Though</hi> Balaack <hi>would give me an houſe full of ſilver and gold, I cannot goe beyond the Commandement of the Lord, Numb.</hi> 22.18. and yet he loved the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of iniquity; and indeed thoſe that undertake ſo much in their owne ſtrength, they come afterward to be weary of the Lord, and weary of his Commandements: as <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. and they ſay at laſt, <hi>It is in vaine to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances?</hi> Mal. 3.14. Theſe are but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105680:52"/> like waſhed ſwine, that will crop graſſe for a while in a faire Paſture, but if you keepe them long there, they will not delight in ſuch manner of feeding, but will rather chooſe to go into the mire; but as for goats they will delight in the Commandments of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2. It is not a very hard thing unto them, nor grievous for them to keep ſolemne faſting dayes together, they come wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, they delight to come, therefore the difference will be hardly diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and unles you be a Chriſtian of a very cleere diſcerning, you will not finde the difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Object.</label> But an hypocrite will not delight in all Gods Commandments; if you take <hi>Herod,</hi> he will delight in <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> preaching, and reforme many things, but if it come to his not having his brother <hi>Philip's</hi> wife, then put <hi>John</hi> into priſon, and in the matter of <hi>Herodias</hi> off with <hi>John's</hi> head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> Wee ſee what hypocrites profeſſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us, we will heare it and doe it:</hi> But you will ſay not <hi>alwayes.</hi> It is true, a difference in time will grow; but while they hold forth univerſall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105680:53"/> where will the difference be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned? Diſcerned it will be when the Lord leadeth them forth with workers of iniquity, but many times they may be lead on to their death before they be diſcovered. And therefore what will the ſervants of God ſay? I have ſeene hypocrites (to outward view) well rooted, &amp; more comfortable than I my ſelfe; and for zeale and love, the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> would have plucked out their eyes to have done <hi>Paul</hi> good; they thought themſelves bleſſed in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, bleſſed ſoules, they took themſelves to be: Whereas the deare ſervants of God have much adoe to ſee ſo much goodneſſe in themſelves, as upon that ground to faſten any evidence of their bleſſedneſſe, becauſe hypocrites will goe cheeke by joule along with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Object.</label> But you will ſay an hypocrite can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ayme at God as his laſt end, but will out-ſhoot God in his owne bowe, and at the higheſt he ſeeketh no more than his owne ſalvation, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the glory of God in it.</p>

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105680:53"/> received; but in the meane while it is much that an hypocrite will doe, and ſo much that a poore Chriſtian will be put to much exerciſe to finde a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between himſelfe and him. <hi>Jehu</hi> did not only thinke that he had zeale for the Lord, as he ſaid, <hi>Come ſee my zeale for the Lord of hoſts;</hi> but good <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab</hi> did likewiſe ſo perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore did readily joyne with him in his reformation: and when he proclaimed a ſacrifice for <hi>Baal,</hi> he thought that <hi>Jehu</hi> would not pollute himſelfe in the Temple of <hi>Baal.</hi> Thus therefore ſomtimes it cometh to paſſe, becauſe that an hypocrite may for a long time finde all his owne ends at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in ſeeking the glory of God, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did: but in concluſion, when a man and his owne glory muſt part, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he muſt hold to his owne honour, or he muſt neglect it &amp; keepe him cloſe to the honour of God: but in the meane time what can I tell, will an honeſt ſoule ſay, but that I may ſhake hands with, and bid farewell unto Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when his and mine lye at ſtake toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> No: Perſecution will not cleere the difference, for though the ſtony ground indeed fell off upon point of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet the thorny ſoile did not ſo: many Papiſts have died for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and how much more then may ſome hypocrites doe it, yea, even give his body to be burned, and yet want Jeſus Chriſt, and everlaſting ſalvation by him? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. Now when a poore Chriſtian cometh, and ſeeth how much ſuch an one doth magnifie God, both in doing and ſuffering, and yet falleth away, it maketh him conclude, ſurely I alſo at the length ſhall turne away from the Lord. So that whether you looke at the Root, or Rule, or Scope and Bent of holines, an hypocrite will carry all things in ſo faire a way, that you ſhall hardly diſcover him to his very death, and when a Chriſtian comes to meaſure his owne ſanctification by this mans, he will verily thinke the one to be as light as the other, and unles it be one that hath his wits well exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, marvellous much adoe he hath to cleare himſelfe in ſuch a point as this.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105680:54"/> There be that thinke there is no reality in hypocriticall ſanctification, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is a reall worke, and not a meere counterfeit of ſpirituall gifts. There are indeed ſome that doe meerly pretend it, and do but outwardly make faire weather in their profeſſion, but believe it, it is not ſo in all hypocrites: there is a reall worke in ſome. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4,5. <hi>They are inlightned and have taſted,</hi> &amp;c. which things are reall and not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, God caſting in their owne ends, and their owne glory in their way, the ſervants of God have given them the right hand of fellowſhip, and ſo long they have held out, that it was never knowne when they did Apoſtate: yea, and ſo glorious may this ſanctification be, that it may dazell the eyes of the beſt of Gods children, &amp; eſpecially of poore Chriſtians, and moſt of all diſcourage when they are ſeene to fall away. This very point hath been one principall Root of Arminianiſme, as another is, that men receive Chriſt by their owne Free will: they are able to prove that there is not onely a pretence in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, but reall worke, and ſo indeed the Scripture doth call it, <hi>ſanctification,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105680:55"/> Heb.</hi> 10.29. Now hereupon they doe believe that the very beſt of the ſervants of God may depart from and forſake their juſtifying faith; but therein they ſhew the bleat of a goat, and in ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they condemne the generation of the righteous: it is true, that the beſt of their Arminian righteouſnes may dye, for they have knowne no more but the way of works. Thus much for the firſt Propoſition.</p>

It is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted to be ſo in the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and in time of temptation and deſertion, as alſo when a man looketh at his juſtification, and at the glory of God; <hi>Woe is me, for I am uncleane</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) at ſuch a time: there is ſo much power of fleſh, even in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Chriſtians, ſpecially in young Chriſtians, ſo much power in their luſts and in their paſſions, as will put their beſt friends to a ſtand what to thinke of them, and much more themſelves, when as they come to be preſſed with the power of their corruptions, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when they compare with ſuch hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105680:55"/> as run away with more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſpirit than themſelves; for ſometimes their corruptions doe leſſe appeare, and they are more free from temptations, and not expoſed to ſuch ſinfull courſes, which ſometimes true hearted Chriſtians are ſubject unto. So a poore Chriſtian is diſcouraged, &amp; an hypocrite emboldened, ſeeing himſelfe more ſanctified than the other in view.</p>

                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 3.</label> That, true ſanctification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtian is not diſcerned by him, nor is indeed diſcernable, untill he firſt diſcerne his juſtifying faith. A double ground of it, &amp; ſo leave it to your chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diſquiſition and ſearch; they are both taken from the neceſſity of faith, both to the acceptance of a mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and worke: there is a neceſſity of the activenes of faith in a mans ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; <hi>The Lord had reſpect to Abel, and to his offering,</hi> Gen. 4.4. A mans perſon muſt firſt be accepted, otherwiſe all his worke will not goe beyond the worke of a legall Chriſtian; and <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> no acceptance therefore without faith. It is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the performance of all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties; for all ſanctification is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105680:56"/> from that faith which Chriſt doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey into the ſoule: Now if the juſt man live by his faith, whether it be the life of ſanctification, or conſolation, then no Chriſtian can diſcerne his ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be lively, but he muſt diſcerne his faith living in it, he muſt ſee his faith deriving ſtrength and grace and life from Chriſt, or elſe he cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his ſanctification to be the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Goſpell; for as there can be no true ſanctification unleſſe there be faith, whereby the perſon is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and whereby life is received to act in all ſanctification; ſo there can be no knowledge of ſanctification, but there muſt be knowledg of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a mans perſon is accepted, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtrength is conveyed to ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for if a poore ſoule be doubtfull of his acceptance with the Lord, he is where hee was, notwithſtanding his ſanctification, and wanteth comfort, for this doubt remaineth, whether he be accepted or no, which (untill the Lord doe manifeſt a mans faith unto him by the revelation of the holy Ghoſt) he is ſtill at a loſſe in it; for though true ſanctification be an evidence of a mans
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105680:56"/> juſtification, yet it ſelfe muſt be firſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Thus we ſee by this third expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a further light is required to the light of ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Prop. 4.</label> Notwithſtanding this neere reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between legall and evangelicall holines, yet there is a reall difference between them, and ſuch a difference as is diſcernable to Chriſtians, whoſe wite are exerciſed in the wayes of the Spirit, and in the word of God, and is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the revelation or manifeſtation of the Spirit of God, both of the ſtate and worke of good Chriſtians; and that ordinarily alſo: for I would not count it extraordinary, being that which the Lord by his Spirit doth uſually reveale unto his people. A reall difference there is both in the Roote and in the Rule, and in the Scope which they ayme at, and ſo it will appeare to be at the laſt day. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.23. <hi>Depart from me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you workers of iniquity, I never knew you;</hi> though they came and told him that they wrought by faith in him: indeed they ſtood in ſome relation to him, but not as members to the head, onely as branches to the vine, which may be cut off, and yet the vine not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105680:57"/> maimed; but if the members ſhould be cut off any one from another, then is the body maimed, but Chriſt will not ſuffer his body to be maimed: but take you never ſo many branches from the vine, and it is not maimed, but will bring forth more: if therefore there be no more fellowſhip between Chriſt &amp; a Chriſtian, than between the branches and the vine, you may take them away and yet not hurt the vine. But wherein ſhould this relation ſtand? It is very hard to conceive, inſomuch that thoſe, who have been moſt exact and diligent to enquire into it, have profeſſed that it is Angels worke; very hard it is ſo to diſtinguiſh them from Gods owne children, ſo as not to diſcomfort poor chriſtians, nor to imbolden hypocrites. Wee muſt be tender therefore, that the leaſt of Gods children may not want their bread: better leave 99 ſheepe, than that one poore ſtray ſheepe ſhould not be ſought after; and better an 100 hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites periſh, than that one poor Chriſtian ſhould want his portion: and yet it is not meet that hypocrites ſhould allow themſelves in the eſtate and fellowſhip of the Saints, and yet
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105680:57"/> alwayes bleſſe themſelves in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condition. If you ſhall ask a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Root, both of them are partakers of the Holy Ghoſt; Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may have a taſt, and a poor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will feare that his beſt fellowſhip with Chriſt is but a taſt, and that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold experience maketh good. Wherein then lyeth the difference? Doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God leave the heart of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite ſtony and unmelted? It is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with the ſtony, but not with the thorny ſoile; for the hearts of ſome Hypocrites are melted, as iron ſtones, they may come to melt about their owne eſtates, through fear, and ſo all thoſe melt that want not depth of earth, as the thorny ſoile did not; but mind you, they will grow hard again, as iron or lead will doe after it is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Now look at the Spirit of God when he cometh to work effectually, and he doth not onely melt the heart, but <hi>taketh away the heart of ſtone, and giveth an heart of fleſh;</hi> for it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to breake a ſtone, it will be a ſtone though it be broken; but when the Lord changeth it into fleſh, then it will be hard no more: But though a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105680:58"/> man may have many temptations, yet the Lord will keep his heart ſoft for ever. And this is that which I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve touching the witneſſe of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>You ſee what workes of God are found in Hypocrites, and therefore what dangerous deceits we are ſubject unto, if God be not more mercifull.</p>
                  <p>Againe, you ſee what ſtate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are brought unto, when their Converſion and Faith is wrought in them, and how it is not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſight of their ſanctification, but is revealed in an Abſolute Promiſe of free grace, and ſo is the ſoule built up in the Aſſurance of its good eſtate, and groweth faithfull through Chriſt, and not in Hypocriſy: This is the true reſt of the ſoule when it groweth up in a lively Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and yet reſteth not in this, that it is ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but doth look principally after Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and bleſſeth God for ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, making uſe of it for thoſe ends for which God hath given it, but dares not reſt in it as the ground of his bleſſedneſſe. This is the firſt difference betweene Hypocrites and Gods owne
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105680:58"/> Servants in the root, though both may work in the name of Chriſt, yet, as the one is temporary, and the other perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth, ſo this difference you ſhall find between common and ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that not onely when Legall Chriſtians are blaſted of God, but even then when they doe moſt flouriſh in their profeſſion. The true Faith of the Goſpel of Chriſt is never prefident of his owne ſtrength (though they that have it ſometimes be, as <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 26.33,35.) but it is out of himſelfe in Chriſt, whereas the Legall Chriſtian is confident of his Faith, that he can make uſe of it to theſe and theſe ends which are before him, he thinketh there is no more needfull, but to look up unto Chriſt, and ſo his work is done: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as take you the ſtrongeſt Faith of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> who were grown to ſuch height, that none of the Churches were before them, yet the Apoſtle doth not think their Faith ſtrong enough, but prayeth for ſupply of ſomething lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Faith, otherwiſe when it is at the beſt, it will warpe: whereas one that hath but a temporary Faith, is confident in the ſtrength of that faith,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105680:59"/> inſomuch that it doth not fear, but to carry an end his profeſſion in a ſafe courſe to Gods glory and his owne. Thus we ſee there is a reall difference between the preſence and work of the Spirit in an Hypocrite, and in a Child of God. In particular, we ſee there is a difference in the Faith which is given to both of them; the one hath confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in himſelfe, the other in <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Iſa. 26.12,13. This is the firſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the root of their profeſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is Difference alſo in the Rule by which they walk, though both ſeek to the word, and delight in that, you ſhall not difference them there, yet this difference you ſhall find in their apprehenſions; the one is confident of his comfort that he hath in the word, the other ſeeth need that the Lord ſhould maintaine his comfort for him, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>David</hi> prayeth thus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as being ſenſible that this their comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table frame of ſpirit would ſoon faile them, and they would quickly grow liftleſſe unto ſuch ſpirituall works as then they had been about; and this is the nature of true Conſolation in Chriſt, it maketh a man to have recoure
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:105680:59"/> unto the Author of it to preſerve it. Now though both attend unto the word, yet here they differ, the one hath enough if he can ſee the Rule, like to the Iſraelites, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. they have enough if they have the rule, but a true Chriſtian, attending rightly unto his rule, findeth it farre off from him to walk according to it, unleſſe the Lord be pleaſed ſo to ſet it home unto him, as that by his power he may be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an end in obedience unto it: for though he know and ſee his Rule, yet he wanteth help to rule his heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his rule; otherwiſe though the rule be ſtreight, yet his walking will be crooked, as a child will write crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though his line be ſtreight: So a Chriſtian man is ſenſible how his feet and hands will ſhake when he cometh to walk or doe any thing according to a rule; therefore he doth wholly look unto Chriſt, as being ſenſible of his owne inability, unleſſe he find help and ſtrength from him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There is difference alſo in the ſcope and End which they aime at; though both aime at the glory of God, yet both cannot attaine unto this, to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:105680:60"/> make the glory of God their laſt end, but the one of theſe doe ſecretly wind about to his owne glory in the end, as <hi>Jehu</hi> doth, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.16. <hi>Come ſee my zeale that I have for the Lord,</hi> but he bringeth about his owne glory by it: and here is the maine deceit of the work, he ſeeketh the glory of God in himſelfe, and in his owne hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the principall care of Gods owne people, is and ought to be the glory of God in Jeſus Chriſt. But the Hypocrite his chief care is to have it ſeen that God is glorified by his hand, <hi>Come ſee the zeale that I have.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Object.</label> You will ſay, <hi>Is it not a great glory unto God to be glorified by my hand?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> Yes, but there is a great deceit in it, for many a man will work much, ſo far as his owne glory is wrapped up in his actions, and like it well ſo long as God may be glorified in him. But all this while he wanteth thoſe ſingle affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions after the glory of God, though in the hand of another.</p>
                  <p>But how then ſhould a man ſeek to promote the glory of God? If it be the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, that a man ſeeketh after, he will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:105680:60"/> then rejoyce as much that God may be glorified by his brother, as by himſelf; and that's the ſpirit of a true Iſraelite indeed: So that <hi>the Name of Chriſt be magnified, it's no matter by whom, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doe rejoyce, yea and will rejoyce,</hi> ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.18. If any man therefore aimeth at Gods glory, then onely when it may be an honour to him in his profeſſion, no thank to him for that; much cloſe work may be found, ſo long as both are carryed an end together: But if when I hear that my Brother glorifieth God, I could have wiſhed that ſuch a thing had been done or ſpoken by me, &amp; it is the worſe, becauſe it is not done by my hands: if that which is the rich good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to my Brother, be not alſo my rejoycing, it is becauſe of the core of Hypocriſy in my heart.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we ſeen particularly the difference between legall and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>We proceed ſtill in the fourth Uſe, to a fifth Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>If Jeſus Chriſt be the firſt gift that is given to the Children of God, before he giveth right unto Promiſes, or to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:105680:61"/> me to challenge Promiſes, yea, before he giveth me any other gifts of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace: then any ſoule may ask this Queſtion.</p>

                     <label>Queſt. 5.</label> 
                     <hi>Of what uſe are Promiſes, if it be not to bring me to Chriſt? yea eſpecially to what end are conditionall Promiſes made (that is to ſay, Promiſes to ſuch and ſuch Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications) if I may not take a Promiſe in one hand, and a Qualification in the other hand, and bring them both to God, and lay hold upon Chriſt with both hands, in the ſtrength of this Promiſe made to this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification?</hi> Thus ariſeth the Queſtion, if God give Jeſus Chriſt firſt, before any other bleſſing, as we read before, to <hi>Abraham and to his ſeed were the Promiſes made</hi> (he meaneth unto <hi>Chriſt</hi>) <hi>and all the Promiſes are in him Yea, and in him Amen:</hi> No having of Promiſes then before Chriſt. To what purpoſe are they given, if not to bring me unto Chriſt? It is a point needfull to be knowne, becauſe we read Promiſes in Scripture daily, and certainly great uſe is to be made of them; and if we ſhall make no other uſe of them, but to bring us unto Chriſt, and God hath not ſanctified them to that end, then
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:105680:61"/> we ſhall take them all in vaine, and the Name of God that is called upon them.</p>

                     </hi> and that is no vaine uſe of Promiſes, for a man to know by them the great good things that are treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in Jeſus Chriſt by the Father; therefore they are called <hi>great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Promiſes,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they declare the <hi>great and pretious

Thus all the Promiſes of Grace declare his excellency: as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. So doe all the Promiſes declare him to be a plentifull Saviour, and a mighty Redeemer of all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

Is there not pardon of ſin, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of bleſſings in Jeſus Chriſt? Thus is the ſoul exhorted, not onely to look for mercy, but not to reſt till he may enjoy it. Though it be not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that can by their owne power carry men an end, yet this is the end to which God giveth them, to ſtir up the Sons of men, not to reſt in beholding the good things in the Promiſes, but to exhort them to provoke themſelves and one another, to look after the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105680:63"/> Lord; thus did the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and teſtified to them of the free grace of God in his Promiſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. and indeed the Promiſes are ſtrong grounds of Exhortation to ſtir up the ſpirits of all Gods people to look to Jeſus Chriſt, and to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in whom ſuch abundance of rich grace is laid up. Thus doe the Promiſes of God furniſh both Miniſters and people, with <hi>Doctrine,</hi> with <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> with <hi>Exhortation,</hi> in their kinds.</p>
                  <p>Now there is a three-fold effect that they have in ſome of all ſorts, good and bad, that live in the boſome of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 They have a power of illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they will enlighten the minds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Hypocrites, and men indued with no more than common gifts, as well as the people of God; of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>who were once enlighted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and had taſted of the good word of God;</hi> An Hypocrite may have ſuch a taſt of Chriſt in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and be</p>
                  <p n="2">2 So affected with it, that he deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all other things in compariſon of it; ſo as that he cometh to reſolve for
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:105680:63"/> his part never to forgoe him; and hath ſo much confidence in God, that he ſaith with <hi>Haman, Whom will the King delight to honour more than my ſelfe?</hi> and this illumination he taketh to be a ſtrong and effectuall Converſion unto the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Promiſes have a worke of conviction, if any man refuſe or deſpiſe them, they leave him unexcuſable, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.24,25,26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus is their blood juſtly upon their owne head, that refuſe and deſpiſe the Promiſes, and they ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their condemnation another day; and to this end the Apoſtle ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth uſe of a pretious Promiſe of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38,39,40,41. A ſtrange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſuch a gratious Promiſe; a ſigne, there is a power in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, even unto this end.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee there is a marvelous gratious uſe of Promiſes before Union with Chriſt; as to help Miniſters and people with matter of Doctrine and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and Exhortation; as alſo to awaken men unto Illumination, and Affection, and Conviction, and to ſeal them up unto everlaſting deſtruction, if they turn their backs upon them.</p>

                     <label>2</label> As the Promiſes are of uſe before our Union with Chriſt, ſo <hi>In our union with him</hi> they are of great uſe; for when the Lord giveth himſelfe to the ſoule, he doth it in a Promiſe; he cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule, riding (as it were) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chariot of a Promiſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth Faith back again in the ſoul by the Promiſe, whereby we receive Jeſus Chriſt; though before him we can have no Promiſe, yet in a Promiſe we doe receive him. This is the very firſt ſtroke of cloſing with Chriſt, he giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and we take him as he offereth himſelfe, even in an abſolute Promiſe; ſuch a like diſpenſation of himſelfe we read of, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25,26. where Chriſt is offered in an Abſolute Promiſe of free grace, without any Qualification mentioned, <hi>Howbeit many of them that heard the word believed, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>umber of the men were about five thouſand</hi> about three thouſand of them believed before, ſo that here are two thouſand that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon this Abſolute Promiſe, the Lord Chriſt is offered to them, and they receive him by Faith. The like we read alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43,44. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his name,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:105680:64"/> whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And <hi>while</hi> Peter <hi>yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the words;</hi> to that the Holy Ghoſt giveth himſelfe, and they receive him in an abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; and left it ſhould be a matter of abſolute doubt unto any, conſider thus much, that whereas the Lord doth u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite himſelfe to the ſoule, as a Father to a child, or as an Husband to a wife, it is free: For did you ever know a true reall Marriage made in a Conditionall Promiſe? Doth a man ſay to his wife, <hi>If you prove a loving and a kind wife, then I will be thine Husband?</hi> Or doth a wife ſay to her Husband, <hi>If you will take me and love and maintaine me, and all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that God ſhall bleſſe us with, then I will be your wife?</hi> Would not your ſoule riſe againſt ſuch a Covenant as this? Now I beſeech you conſider whether we ſhall not put an unſpeakable diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the Covenant of free grace, to conceive and expect, that if we carry our ſelves thus and thus, then God will be ours, and we his: But if thus and thus, then he will caſt us off; Hath the Lord made ſuch a Covenant with his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:105680:65"/> Elect? Indeed the Lord would have the <hi>Jewes</hi> to know, that though he were marryed to them, yet he would not continue that Covenant, but upon condition of obedience; when they were diſobedient, the Lord gave them a bill of Divorce; but in the Covenant of Grace (ſpoken of, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19,20.) the Lord giveth himſelfe, and you take him in an abſolute Promiſe; and now the Lord dwelleth in you, and the ſoul yieldeth up it ſelfe unto God, to be wholly at his diſpoſing, and doth not ſtint nor limit God upon this and this condition, nor doth the Lord ſo bind us to the performance of any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that if it be not found, the Covenant will be voyd, yet he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many things of us (as an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will doe of his wife) as to be meek and lowly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if we faile, the Covenant is not broken; therefore believe it, it doth much diſhonour the Covenant of Grace, to lay the weight of our intereſt in it, upon any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by which we might plead our right unto it. I confeſſe that the Lord doth uſually give himſelfe in a <hi>future Promiſe,</hi> which makes us conceive that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:105680:65"/> it is not ſo abſolute a Covenant: when perſons give themſelves one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they give themſelves abſolutely, and not in a future Promiſe, and ſay, <hi>I take thee to be my wife, and I take thee to be mine Husband;</hi> but all times are alike unto God, that if the Lord ſay, <hi>I will marry thee to me in tender mercies, and faithfullneſſe, and loving kindneſſe,</hi> he doth that for the preſent, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to doe; and againe it breeds in the ſoule a Reciprocall Union, that though it know not whether the Lord hath given himſelfe, yet this it findeth, namely, a patient waiting with hope, that the Lord will ſhew mercy at the length: as when a woman hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of marriage from her Husband, ſhe waiteth in hope untill he give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: ſo there is an Union or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, when the ſoule doth waite upon God, but when the Lord giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more fully, then he ſpeaketh more plainly, and giveth himſelfe, not in a future, but in a preſent Promiſe; and now the ſoule ſeeth that the Lord hath gracious fellowſhip with him, for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee that promiſes are not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105680:66"/> vaine things, but there are great uſe of them, <hi>before</hi> our Union all promiſes are of excellent uſe: <hi>in</hi> our Union the Lord giveth himſelfe in an abſolute promiſe onely, but to take Chriſt in a Conditionall promiſe, by vertue of the Condition, is incompatible to a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</p>

                     <hi>After our union with Chriſt,</hi> they are of more abundant uſe.

                  <p n="1">1 They ſerve us for <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to teach us that there is not onely free grace in Chriſt, but there are gifts of grace in him, and all the treaſures of the good things of God are in him, and all the bleſſings of the promiſes made unto Qualifications, are layd up in him alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They ſerve for <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> to direct us whither to look for Qualifications, and the bleſſings promiſed unto them alſo, namely, to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to receive the bleſſing through him, and the Qualification by the ſame hand; for they are firſt fulfilled in him: there is no good Condition but it is found
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:105680:66"/> in Chriſt, no bleſſing thereunto, but it is found in him alſo; in him therfore they are to be ſought for: ſo that though a poor ſoule ſee himſelfe wretched, and blind, and naked, yet he hath an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in whom all riches are laid up; this he is taught to know by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and directed alſo to goe to Jeſus Chriſt, that enjoying him, he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all good things in him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They are of uſe to ſtirre up unto <hi>Prayer,</hi> for now I ſee that all theſe good things are in Chriſt, and in him they muſt be enjoyed, if they be enjoyed at all; hereupon the ſoule is ſet a work (the Holy Ghoſt concurring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with) to conſider, Is there ſo much grace in Chriſt, and in him abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Hath the Lord made ſo many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious promiſes unto ſuch and ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Qualifications? whether then ſhould I goe, either for the one, or for the other, but unto Chriſt, that he may work in us a ſpirit of Faith, of Love, and of a ſound mind? and whatſoever elſe we ſtand in need of? <hi>Give unto thy Servant a wiſe and an underſtanding heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> when the Lord bad him ask what he ſhould give him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3.9. Thus are the Servants of God ſtirred
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:105680:67"/> up by Conditionall promiſes, to ſeek unto the Lord for the ſupply of all their wants, for in him are all good things laid up, and by him are they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto his ſervants.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 They are of uſe to helpe us to <hi>Know our ſpirituall ſtate, and means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern thereof:</hi> All theſe qualifications to which the promiſes are made, are fruits of the Spirit, and will more or leſſe declare unto you, your ſanctified ſtate, which is a marvelous bleſſing: Upon the promiſes made unto ſuch conditions, the Lord ſtirreth up the hearts of his people, to ſeek for ſuch conditions to which the promiſes are made, and when the Lord hath given them, he then openeth their hearts to ſee what he hath given them, and ſo to diſcern their ſanctified eſtate. <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt me, ſeeing thou haſt not with-held thy Son, thine onely Sonne from me;</hi> ſo the Lord ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22.12. wherein he bare witneſſe to his work, and this doth fill <hi>Abraham</hi> with ſtrong Conſolation, together with the Oath of God unto him: for now the Lord doth not onely know it, but cauſe him to know it alſo: ſo that if
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105680:67"/> the Lord doth but breath in ſuch fruit of the Spirit, if he doth but give pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the ſoule to doe ſuch a work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the promiſe is made, and doe make it appear unto the ſoule to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch by the revelation of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit, then doth the Lord fill the ſoule with Conſolation: But though the Holy Ghoſt himſelfe doth not ſo ſweetly and ſtrongly breath, and clear up his own Teſtimony, by the comfort which he giveth unto the ſoule in ſuch a promiſe, yet a man by the Promiſe may (being enlightned of God) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne what God hath done for him; and hereby the ſoule may ſtay it ſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.18. <hi>The expectation of the poore ſhall not periſh for ever:</hi> When the poor ſoule is meekned by Gods hand, and the Lord letteth him ſo diſcern it, that now he quietly reſteth upon the Lord, now the Spirit of God doth help <hi>David</hi> along to be ſupported with ſome ſtay; and beſides the waiting of a Chriſtian upon him, who hath made the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, doth make him yet more patient and hopefull. And this is a fourth uſe of Conditionall promiſes, to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Faith.</p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:105680:68"/>
                  <p n="5">5 They are of uſe to work all theſe qualifications in us, to which the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are promiſed, by the <hi>exceeding pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Promiſes, we are made partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. and this is no ſmall work or uſe of theſe promiſes, that from them ſhould ſpring all our gratious qualifications; for the Lord having promiſed ſuch bleſſings in them, theſe promiſes being received and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and meditated on by us, <hi>we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them, and the glory of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in them, are changed into the ſame I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from glory to glory, even as by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. This great power there is in the Promiſes, to help an end the work of God in the ſoul of a Chriſtian: ſo that though they were never given to bring us to Chriſt, yet to this end they were given, to work all thoſe qualifications in us, to which the bleſſings are promiſed. Yea, and they may truly be ſaid to be given to bring us to Chriſt, in this ſenſe, That though our Faith be not begotten by any promiſes to gratious qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prae-exiſtent in us; yet they may beget ſuch qualifications of Faith, to which promiſes are made.</p>

                  <p n="7">7 They are of uſe further, to <hi>ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Faith:</hi> for the Lord that hath made ſuch Promiſes, will accompliſh them for his Servants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9,10. <hi>Jacob</hi> there putteth the Lord in mind of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and ſaid, <hi>O God of my father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and God of my father Iſaac, the Lord which ſaidſt unto me, Returne unto thy Countrey, and to thy Kindred, and I will deale well with thee;</hi> and he was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned according to the appointment of God, but what now, doth he plead the condition? mind in the next words, <hi>I am not worthy the leaſt of all the mercy, and of all the truth, which thou haſt ſhewed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105680:69"/> unto thy Servant?</hi> yet now though he pleadeth not any worth at all, yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord had promiſed ſuch a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to him, he prayeth for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother.</hi> Thus his faith is ſtrengthned, though he doth not plead any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to receive mercy. So alſo doe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute promiſes ſtrengthen faith, and the prayer of faith, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.13,14, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> The Lord there promiſeth <hi>David,</hi> that he would build him an houſe, and that he would not take his mercy from his Children, this ſtirreth up and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the faith of <hi>David,</hi> ver. 28, 29, <hi>&amp;c. This well ordered and ſure Covenant of God was all his ſtay, and all his ſalvation though his houſe was not ſo with God,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. So when the Lord promiſeth to heal the backſlidings of his people, <hi>Ho.</hi> 14.5. their hearts are ſtrengthned to come unto the Lord, and ſay, <hi>O Lord thy words are true, let it pleaſe thee to heal the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings of thy ſervants.</hi> Thus by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, the Faith and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prayers of his ſervants, are both ſtrengthned together.</p>
                  <p>Now let me further ſay thus much, let us rightly diſcern what uſe to make
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105680:69"/> of the principall part of the Scriptures, take heed you doe not cloſe with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes before we have Jeſus Chriſt in them: eſpecially take heed you make not uſe of a promiſe to a gratious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, to give you your part in Chriſt, neither be taken aſide to make account that the Lord did give you himſelfe gratiouſly in a conditionall promiſe, for theſe are aberrations from the Covenant of grace: conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well what the promiſes be, and what uſe the Lord would have us to make of them, it is not for a woman to take her husbands inheritance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee take his perſon; &amp; you know that all the bleſſings and all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are (as it were) the Inheritance of the Lord Jeſus, given unto him and to no other but in his name, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is not any ſoule under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that can challenge his Right in Chriſt at the firſt by any promiſe, till Chriſt firſt be given, either in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or in ſome former: if you know that you are in Chriſt, you may know that the promiſes are yours, otherwiſe you ſhall not be able to know your right in Chriſt by your right in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105680:70"/> promiſes; and therefore doe not turne them upſide downe beyond the ſcope and intendment of the promiſes of the Covenant of grace: we may take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by them to admire the goodneſſe and grace of God, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19. Thus ought we to conſider of them, and whither to looke that we might enjoy them, and the bleſſings in them: If you ſhall ſay we have been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and have had gratious changes wrought in us; be not deceived, ſuch worke may reach no farther than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and you may come to turne your backs upon Jeſus Chriſt. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore did ever the Lord give himſelfe to be one with you; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord doth ſtrike up the bond of Union, it is in a free promiſe of his grace.</p>
                  <p>Truſt not therefore upon every lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your ſoule upon conditionall promiſes, for ſo you may build upon a Covenant made upon a worke, and ſo you and your Covenant may faile together. But when you read how the Lord hath made ſuch promiſes to ſuch and ſuch qualifications, then conſider, that thoſe things are indeed requiſite
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105680:70"/> to be found in you, but who is there in heaven or earth that can worke them in you, there is none but Jeſus Chriſt, and unleſſe you have him to be in you, you cannot have any of theſe things wrought in you. But will a poore ſoule ſay, I am not able to reach the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, therefore all the promiſes doe fall heavie upon a man, and he ſeeth that they are too burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and too weighty for him: he doth not ſay, here is the qualification, and here is the bleſſing promiſed to it, and therefore I will take it to my ſelfe, but one that is taught of God, doth forthwith goe and pray unto God, that he will ſet him in the way of thoſe bleſſings, and that ſo he will make him partaker of them, he prayeth that God will give him his Sonne, and that he will adorne him with his grace, as a bride of Jeſus Chriſt. Thus while the ſoule doth looke towards Jeſus Chriſt, and grace in him, the Lord doth ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſforme him into the image of Chriſt, by working ſuch qualifications in him, and then beareth witneſſe to that ſanctification, which is wrought in his heart, thereby enlarging his ſoule
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105680:71"/> with ſtrong conſolation in Jeſus Chriſt; and in the ſame way it is that the Lord doth ſtrengthen the faith of his people to believe, that all thoſe things, which God hath promiſed, are accompliſhed in Jeſus Chriſt, and the Law fullfilled in me ſo farre as Chriſt is in me, and therefore I come unto God in prayer to make good thoſe promiſes unto me, in a right way, which would have been prepoſterouſly applyed before Chriſt was given: And this may ſerve for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Queſt. 6.</label> Wee come now unto a ſixt Queſtion. If the Lord doe give himſelfe firſt in the Covenant of his grace, this may then be a doubt and a queſtion in a Chriſtian ſoule, If God give himſelfe before any bleſſing, before any promiſe in order of nature (though he giveth himſelfe alwayes in a promiſe) if wee cannot claime any bleſſing from God at the firſt in any conditionall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, therefore not by any condition in our ſelves, but as we received all things from God, ſo wee claime all things from him in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo doe firſt ſeeke for him, and for all things in him: If thus, to what uſe then
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105680:71"/> ſerveth the Law of God, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſuch and ſuch conditions in us, doe we not abrogate the Law, &amp; make it of none effect, and roote it out from having any power over Chriſtians? And truly ſome, under pretence of the Covenant of grace, have thought it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together bootleſſe to bind Chriſtians unto the Law of God, and to looke at it as any part of the direction of their Courſe. Now becauſe this is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation uſually reflected upon the Covenant of Grace, let us Confider therefore and enquire to what uſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Law of God, if God give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe firſt unto his people in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of his grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> Though the Lord giveth himſelfe freely to the ſoule, and his Sonne, and all the bleſſings of the Covenant of grace, without reſpect unto any worke of the Law; yet the Law is of ſpeciall and notable uſe unto all the ſonnes of men, both unto them that are not yet brought home unto God by convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, and alſo to thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate in Jeſus Chriſt. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did obſerve that the queſtion would ariſe upon the doctrine of the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105680:72"/> Covenant of grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16,17,18. <hi>For if the bleſſing of Abraham came upon the people of God by Jeſus Chriſt, to what end then ſerveth the Law, which came</hi> 430 <hi>yeares after?</hi> It cannot diſanull grace, to make the promiſe of God of none effect? <hi>to what end then ſerveth it?</hi> Some ſay it is of no uſe, others ſay that it is of ſuch uſe that they had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Covenant of grace than it: but the Anſwer is, it is of eſpeciall uſe both unto ſpirituall and carnall men.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, unto carnall men, and they are of two ſorts, ſome belong unto the election of grace, though they be not yet called; others are not written in the Lambs booke of life, but will in the end finally periſh, and the Law is yet of uſe unto both ſorts of them.</p>
                  <p>For the Elect, it is of uſe unto them; to aggravate their ſin, and to multiply it unto them as it were, that is to ſay, to aggravate the apprehenſion of the hainouſneſſe of ſin upon their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and to ſet home the burthen of ſin unto their ſoules, thereby to drive them to feele their great need of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom otherwiſe they ſhould for ever have deſpiſed.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105680:72"/> Thus the Apoſtle anſwereth in the place aforenamed, <hi>The Law was added, becauſe of tranſgreſſions;</hi> that they might cleerely appeare, and be aggravated thereby, that a man might plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne how he hath made himſelfe lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the wrath of God, by ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold breaches of ſo many Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in one kinde or other: the Law giveth cleere knowledge of ſinne, and ſo much the more doth it ſet on the weight of it upon the Conſcience, working feare in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. And hence it is, that the Apoſtle telleth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24. <hi>The Law was our Schoole-Maſter to Chriſt;</hi> As a Schoole-Maſter driveth his Scholler through feare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this or that duty, either to doe it himſelfe, or (if he cannot) to get o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to doe it for him; ſo the Law of God driveth the ſoule through feare unto Jeſus Chriſt; not that it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale Chriſt a Saviour of free-grace, but the ſoule being once brought downe under ſenſe of ſin by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Law, will readily &amp; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly hearken unto the newes of <hi>Chriſt a Saviour;</hi> for being once made ſenſible of his owne inability to redeeme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:105680:73"/> and unworthines to be redeemed from the wrath of God; now is the ſoule fitted to heare the voyce of the Goſpell, now is the newes of Chriſt beautifull and glad tidings: And of this uſe is the Law unto the Elect of God, before they come under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the grace of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But of what uſe is the Law unto other men?

                  <p>For the firſt of theſe; the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 23.1. had kept ſo good a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that he knew not any ſin againſt the Law that he had lived in, but though he was unrebukeable, he did count it all loſſe afterward, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7,8. <hi>Thoſe things that before he thought had heen his gaine, now he counteth them but dung that he may winne Chriſt:</hi> when a man attaineth unto outward confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Law, he is then indeed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to juſtifie himſelfe, and to thinke that it is indeed good for poore ſinfull men to looke for ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt: but for himſelfe he hopeth in his ſelfe-devotion, and that he is able to ſave himſelfe; theſe are ſuch as juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves before men, to whom our Saviour ſpeaketh, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. And of whom he ſaith, that <hi>Publicans and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots ſhall goe into the kingdome of heaven
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105680:74"/> before them.</hi> Mat. 21.31,32. For many times you ſhall have the moſt deboiſt and prophane more humbled and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to hearken to the voyce of Chriſt, and ſooner convinced of the neceſſity of the Covenant of grace, than thoſe that are morally righteous by the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30,31,32. <hi>&amp;</hi> Chap. 10.21. Thus the Law becometh a ſnare unto them, and that which is of ſingular and wholſome uſe unto the children of God, is made death unto them. And as their obedience to the Law is thus a ſnare unto them; So, ſecondly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and comfort which they take in their obedience, is a greater ſnare than the other; The ſtony and thorny ſoile did <hi>heare the word with joy,</hi> and ſo thoſe hypocrites, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58. did <hi>delight to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto God;</hi> but what followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the delight which they tooke in God, and in holy duties, it made them ready to expoſtulate with God, why he did not anſwer them according to their works: the delight which they found did ſo fill their hearts with Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the grace of God, that they looked at their duties, as ſo many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of the love of God unto their
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:105680:75"/> ſoules; and then when men come to finde more comfort in their obedience, than in the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, it maketh them ready to expoſtulate with God touching the worth of their owne righteouſnes. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.10. <hi>Thou haſt found the life of thine hand, therefore thou waſt not grieved;</hi> So long as a man findeth life and comfort in his owne performances, what need can he ſee to be grieved for the want of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> or at the beſt, if he doe grieve and finde his heart comforted in grieving, and delighting in the Courſe of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, he then thinketh he hath no need of being further ſolicitous about his ſpirituall eſtate. Thus we ſee that the Law of God is of marvellous uſe in the dayes of the Goſpell; of great uſe unto thoſe that belong unto God, to breake their hearts for ſinne, and to drive them to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the diſobedience of the Law leaves them without excuſe, that ſo diſobey it. Againe, the obedience of it and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that obedience doth harden the hearts of others from Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> The Apoſtle anſwereth this queſtion, when he ſaith, <hi>I am not without the Law to God, but under the Law to Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.21. So that (mind you) the Law is of uſe unto the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> but how? As the Law cometh under Chriſt, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> cometh under the Law; this is the ſumme of the Anſwer, but that would be further explained. What meaneth he, when he ſayth, <hi>I am under the Law to Chriſt?</hi> In ſome ſenſe a Chriſtian is freed from the Law, in ſome ſenſe he is under the Law; ſo farre as the Law is any way beſides or out of Chriſt, ſo farre the Apoſtle is without the Law; ſo farre as the Law is under Chriſt, ſo farre he is under the Law; keepe cloſe to theſe two principles, and you ſhall ſafely avoyd rockes on every hand, thus by the uſe of the Law ſhall you not goe aſide to a Covenant of works, nor by attendance unto grace, ſhall you neglect the Law. How farre is the Law under Chriſt? When it hath brought
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:105680:76"/> the ſoule neerer unto Chriſt, and in a remote manner prepared him: the Law is in Chriſt, and you ſubject to it in him. 1. As the Law is given by Chriſt. 2. As in Chriſt helpe is given to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it. Firſt, as the Law is given by Chriſt, as 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.2,3. — and many other Commandments he gave them, all which are legall Commandments, and yet the Apoſtle gave them <hi>by the Lord Jeſus.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. to the end of the Chapter. Our Saviour would not have us thinke, that <hi>he came to deſtroy the Law, or the Prophets, but to fullfill them;</hi> and to that end he doth there expound the ſpirituall &amp; true meaning of the Law; that whereas the Phariſees held forth the outward letter of the Law to be obſerved onely, as thinking that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a man did commit the act of <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> he was not guilty of the breach of the ſixt Commandment; and if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not the act of <hi>Adultery,</hi> he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed not the ſeventh Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo of the reſt; Our Saviour Chriſt expoundeth the Law more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, ſhewing that <hi>Anger</hi> againſt a mans brother is a breach of the ſixt Commandment, and <hi>whoſoever ſhall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105680:76"/> looke on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed Adultery with her already in his heart,</hi> and broken the ſeventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath as it were revived <hi>Moſes;</hi> but as the Law given by Chriſt is not a Covenant of works, but a Commandment of well-doing; and he having given it, we take our ſelves bound to be ſubject unto it. The Apoſtle alſo preſſeth the morall Law upon ſeverall relations of men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.1,2,3. &amp;c. It is an honour to Chriſt, that his ſervants ſhould be holy, as he is holy; it is for the glory of God, and he requireth it; the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.8. to the end of the Chapter; <hi>If you fullfill the Royall Law, according to the Scripture, (Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelfe) ye doe well.</hi> And againe, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> Thus wee ſee the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt put it upon Chriſtians to keepe the Law of God; and Chriſt himſelfe beareth witnes to the Law, <hi>for God will never juſtifie ſin to be no ſin, though he will juſtifie the perſon of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the Lord Jeſus giveth the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105680:77"/> Law, and as it were renueth it, ſo he doth alſo give his Spirit unto his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, enabling them to keep it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. Now this Law would he not write in the hearts of his people, nor give unto them his holy Spirit, enabling them to keepe it, were it not his will in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that the Law ſhould be the Rule of holines and righteouſnes unto his people; hence it is that the children of God, though they be not under the Covenant of the Law, yet take themſelves to be bound to the obedience of it, for if <hi>Chriſt</hi> have given the Law as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and if he have ratified it by giving them his Spirit to teach and ſtrengthen them to keepe it, though not perfectly, yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, then they take themſelves bound to obey the Law, though they be under the Covenant of grace; for <hi>doe we make voyd the Law through faith? God forbid; yea, we eſtabliſh the Law;</hi> for what need have Chriſtians of free juſtification by Chriſt, if they were not bound unto the obedience of the Law by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Law? therefore the free juſtification of men under a free Covenant of grace doth eſtabliſh the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:105680:77"/> obedience of the Law; otherwiſe what need they run to Chriſt to ſave them from the Curſe of the Law? Why doe we ſtill run to Chriſt for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Juſtification, but that we find our ſelves ungodly Creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the righteous and holy Law of God? Therefore if God have given men the Law, &amp; his Holy Spirit to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them in the obedience of it, and his grace to ſave them from the curſe of it, then Chriſtians are to know, that they are bound to keep the Law, they lye under the authority of it, and dare not pluck their necks from under that yoke.</p>
                  <p>Now there are divers effects ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the ſubjection of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Commandement of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 As they take themſelves bound to the obedience of it, ſo they believe and many times feele the fatherly diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, when they tranſgreſſe it; now the tranſgreſſion of the Law could not bring them under the diſpleaſure of God, unleſſe they were bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Commandement of the Law: This diſpleaſure <hi>David</hi> was ſenſible of,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105680:78"/> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.1,2,3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he makes many complaints, which doe all of them ſpring from the conſcience of the diſobedience of the Law, which God hath framed in the hearts of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whereby they reflect upon their ſin as the ground of all the diſtempers, which lye upon their bodies or minds. This is the firſt effect of the ſubjection of Gods people to his Law, they lye under the faith and ſenſe of the danger of the diſobedience of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They are under the faith and ſenſe alſo of Gods gratious acceptance of their wayes, when they are ſutable to the bleſſed directions of his word; not that they can raiſe there-from their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified eſtate, but by the ſame Spirit of God, whereby they are helped to obey the Commandements of God, they doe ſee the Lords gratious approbation of them in their poore and weake endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; for <hi>the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,</hi> that is, acknowledgeth and approveth it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.6. When the Lord by his Spirit boweth the hearts of his people unto obedience, then he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and accepteth their obedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. Thus the Lord beareth witneſs
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105680:78"/> unto his Servants, that he doth accept their works; ſo that they ſenſibly know and believe, that the Lord doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their pooreſt and weakeſt endeavours, unto which they are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth by his Spirit, in the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his word: this the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> confirmeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.20. <hi>to</hi> 26. where he ſpeaketh of his righteous dealing with <hi>Saul,</hi> and whereas his enemies laid it to his charge that he was an enemy unto <hi>Saul,</hi> the Lord beareth him witnes, that he had walked toward <hi>Saul</hi> with a good conſcience; now the Lord having led him an end to deale juſtly, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and purely with <hi>Saul,</hi> having kept him from all the malice and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Saul,</hi> and maintained his cauſe againſt him, and delivered him out of his hands, whom the Lord had now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, herein the Prophet ſeeth the Lord accepting him, when in the name of his Son, by the power of his Spirit, he is helped to attend unto the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God. This is commfortable unto a Chriſtian ſpirit, when the Lord beareth witneſſe unto his ſoule, that he hath an eye to all the Commandments of God. And all this argueth, that the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105680:79"/> ſervants of God, being in a ſtate of grace in Jeſus Chriſt, have looked at them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as bound by the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law, and as being under the Law to Chriſt, who hath given the Law and power unto his ſervants ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to keep it, both by writing in their hearts a Law of obedience, and by putting his Holy Spirit within them; for if the people of God were not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their bounden duty to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law of God, they would neither have faith nor ſence of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly diſpleaſure, when they negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently breake theſe Lawes; neither would they be ſenſible of Gods accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their conformity thereunto. But we know what the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lord doth often beare witneſſe unto the integrity of his Servants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the oppoſitions of men. So he did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> and to ſundry of the Servants of God, though they are not wont to build their ſafe eſtate thereupon: Yet this kind of Gods acceptance of their wayes and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they doe diſcern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in their
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105680:79"/> beſt obedience, which they doe perform, they ſee the need they have to goe unto God for juſtifying grace, becauſe if they have failed in any one circumſtance, their beſt righteouſneſſe is polluted, therefore they have need of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to cover the failings of their moſt ſtrict performances; this <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, when he had been very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in reforming the abuſes of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi> and of many other Ordinances of God; and though the Lord had help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to undertake the Reformation with much dexterity and ſucceſſe, yet for all this he runneth unto Chriſt for acceptance and pardon, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.22. And what would he have done if he had been conſcious of ſome groſſe ſin? He would then much more have run to the Lord Jeſus. Thus the Law is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by faith, for there is no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon but is very apprehenſive of his ſins, and ſo of his continuall need of <hi>Chriſt, whoſe blood cleanſeth us from all ſins,</hi> John 1.7. and <hi>who is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>who is an Advocate (if any man ſin) and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for our ſins,</hi> Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.1,2. And
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105680:80"/> what doe all theſe things argue, but that a Chriſtian, being under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the grace of God, doth ſubmit himſelfe unto this yoke of God. Thus far then a Chriſtian is under the Law to Chriſt, ſo far as the Law is under Chriſt; he is under the Command of Chriſt, and under his power and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, if he negligently ſin againſt the Law, and unto Chriſt he runneth for pardon and cleanſing, and unto him he cometh for acceptance of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; ſo that he hath no uſe of the Law but unto Chriſt, and in and under him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how is a Chriſtian not under the Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So far forth as the Law is not under Chriſt, I meane ſo far as it is <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> freely juſtifying us by his grace, ſo far a Chriſtian is freed from under the Law. In one word, a Chriſtian man, under a Covenant of grace, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Covenant of works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>You are not under the Law, but under grace.</hi> He meaneth, not under the Covenant of the Law, nor under the power and authority of the Law, as of their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1,2,3,4. The husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105680:80"/> juriſdiction of the Law is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <hi>The Law is not made for a righteous man,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9. That is, not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Law; for elſe we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Commandments of the Law to Chriſt: But the Jewiſh Teachers taught more, to wit, the Covenant of the Law unto ſalvation: Not but that <hi>the Law is good if a man uſe it lawfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how ſhall a man uſe it lawfully?</hi> for it is not given unto <hi>a righteous man,</hi> but he reckoneth up the breaches of every Commandement, and unto them it is given; <hi>To the lawleſſe and diſobedient, to the ungodly and ſinners, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.9. The Covenant of the Law is given to ſuch (and to none but ſuch) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their ſinnes againſt the Law, to humble them to the death, and to drive them out of themſelves, and all confidence in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how doth it appear that the Covenant of the Law is not given to the Children of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence it is manifeſt, becauſe a Chriſtian man neither looketh for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſilvation from his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law, nor ſeareth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, though he faile in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105680:81"/> and this is a fruit of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from under the Covenant of the Law; for if a man ſhould look for life by his obedience to the Law, and fear condemnation by the breach of it, this would bring a man under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Law; for the ſanction of the Covenant of the Law is <hi>Life</hi> to them that obey, and to them that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey <hi>death and the curſe;</hi> but a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an looketh not for life by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that is plain, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. Therefore no hope of ſalvation from our obedience to the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But me thinks</hi> (you will ſay) <hi>a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may feare his condemnation, becauſe of his diſobedience to the Law?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly this is a great ſnare, and this doctrine will be ſcandalous to many a poor ſoule, but without cauſe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if God give a man to be under the Covenant of grace, and not to ſee it, then he may fear; but if a man know himſelfe to be under the Covenant of grace, then he doth not feare condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from his diſobedience; nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this purpoſe is the confidence of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 49.5. where the Prophet calleth upon all people in the world
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105680:81"/> to take notice of it, both <hi>men of high and low degree: Wherefore ſhould I feare in the dayes of evill, when the iniquities of my heeles ſhall compaſſe me about?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Truly if there be any fear in the world, one would think this ſhould procure it? what ſhould a man fear, if not this: <hi>David</hi> yet profeſſeth it, and would have all men to know it, that there is no cauſe therein why a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man ſhould fear; <hi>wherefore ſhould I fear?</hi> &amp;c. Though it ſhould follow you to the Stocks, or to Priſon, yet there is no cauſe why it ſhould make you fear. <hi>Men that truſt themſelves in their wealth, and boaſt themſelves in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their riches, none of them can by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ranſome for him, that be ſhould ſtill live for ever, and not ſee corruption.</hi> Had <hi>David</hi> had nothing but the wealth of his Kingdome, he might have feared well enough, but here's his confidence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But will not this make a Chriſtian wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton againſt God, and cauſe him to abuſe his liberty to hardneſſe of heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, no, this is the kindly melting of a godly heart, to conſider a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105680:82"/> love, drawing him from the power of the grave, and that he ſhould by his ſins pierce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, this melteth him more than all his other ſins, eſpecially conſidering the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of God, <hi>which where ſin hath abounded, aboundeth much more.</hi> Thus when a man doth not look for life by his owne righteouſneſſe, but knoweth the Redemption of ſoules to be more pretious than ſo, this ſheweth a man not to be under a Covenant of works, and then his very <hi>iniquity</hi> ſhall not make him afraid, there is ſuch a ſtate in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and let all men know it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But will not all men think the worſe of Chriſtian profeſſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, <hi>David</hi> will have all men know it, that they may ſee the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all worldly confidences, and the confidence of Chriſtians; all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of worldly men will leave them to be like the Beaſts that periſh, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not redeem their ſoules, that the Lord onely might be exalted in his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>2</label> As a Chriſtian looketh not for ſalvation by his obedience to the Law, nor feareth condemnation by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105680:82"/> So neither doth he ſeek for any bleſſing from his obedience, nor fear any curſe from his diſobedience. And therefore if there be any Promiſes of bleſſing made to any obedience (though God ſhould help him to as much obedience as might be) he doth not look for any bleſſing from that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4,5,6. He looketh not for his bleſſedneſſe from his works, though he ſhould perform all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to which the Promiſes are made, yet he expecteth all his bleſſing from free Juſtification and union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not ſin;</hi> this is the bleſſedneſſe of Chriſtians. It is true, the Lord doth bleſſe the workings of his ſervants, and accept them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34,35,36.— Thus Chriſt bleſſeth them, but they are not ſenſible of their good deeds, ſo as to expect bleſſings for their obedience ſake, and therefore they make anſwere, and ſay, <hi>Lord when ſaw we thee an hungry, and fed thee, or thirſty, and gave thee drink</hi> &amp;c? Neither do they fear the curſe of God, or that their ſins ſhould ſeparate them from God; thoſe that are under the law indeed are curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:105680:83"/> if they doe not continue in all things that are written in the Law to doe them: But this Curſe is removed from the Elect by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>3</label> This alſo is a third effect of the freedom from the Covenant of works, that a Chriſtian doth not look for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall comfort from his obedience, nor fear conjugall divorce, from his diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. In a Covenant of works it is with a man as it was with <hi>Leah</hi> (<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> wife (who expected love and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip from her Husband, becauſe of her fruitfulnes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.32,34. but thus doth not a man under a Covenant of grace, for when he hath done all he can, he is ready to ſay, <hi>I am an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervant,</hi> Luke 17.10. and doth not chalenge God for any of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, he ſeeth he deſerveth not his daily bread, and ſo looks for no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from his good works; though the Lord will gratiouſly acknowledge his ſervants in what they doe according to his will, yet they are not wont to plead any ſuch thing, which is very obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the practice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.9,10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where he doth not preſſe the <hi>performance of Gods Commandement</hi> to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:105680:83"/> procure any bleſſing, but acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his unworthineſſe, and looketh for grace from the Promiſe of God; <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother, for thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely doe thee good.</hi> Nor doth a Child of God fear divorce by his diſobedience, though it have been very great. Sometimes the people of God have not onely rejected the ſervants of God, but the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.7. But when <hi>Samuel</hi> had preſſed hard upon them for their ſin, Cha. 12. and they were truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, then <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto them (<hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21, 22.) <hi>Fear not,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore feare you not, he will not caſt you off: So that (mind you) a poor Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth not fear divorce from his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, for if we ſhould look for bleſſings from the one, or curſings from the other, we walk as not under Chriſt, but under the Law: But he that is freed from the Covenant of works, is freed alſo from expecting ſalvation, or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing damnation for what he doth: He knoweth the Lord will hide his face from him, if he doe evill, but he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord will not caſt him off for ever, yet he dares not commit ſin, but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:105680:84"/> being under grace, he is the more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted if he ſhall at any time diſpleaſe God, and procure chaſtiſement to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and by this means the Lord doth mortifie his diſtempers; on the other ſide, if he doe well, he will not ſay now my Husband will cleave unto me, and dwell with me: No, no, we are freed from the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. But we were not ſo, if we look for conjugall love from God for our obedience to the law; it is true, if a man be marryed to the Law, his obedience unto it will ſupply comfort unto him, but if we be dead unto the Law, we have no life in it, nor by it, but onely in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> from whom we expect our comfort; indeed we are troubled that we ſhould ſin againſt the grace of God, otherwiſe we look not at our obedience or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to make us accepted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>4</label> And finally, the ſoule doth not claim his right unto any Conditionall Promiſe by his performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nor doth he deny himſe fe the bleſſing that the Promiſe may reach forth unto him, though he be wanting in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to this or that Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105680:84"/> Pregnant for this purpoſe is the example of <hi>Jacob</hi> (which we mentioned before, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9,10. who though he had a plain and a full Promiſe of God to doe him good, if he would returne unto his Countrey, and to his kindred, yet when he did returne according to the word of God, he claimed not his intereſt in that Promiſe, for that he had done as God commanded him, but <hi>I am leſſe than the leaſt of thy mercies,</hi> and yet he cometh unto the Lord for the performance of his Promiſes: but upon this ground, onely for the ſake of mercy and truth. <hi>Deliver me I pray thee, for thou ſaidſt, I will ſurely doe thee good,</hi> verſ. 11, 12. So that (mind you) though the ſoul can make uſe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall Promiſe, and come to God for the bleſſing of it, yet not expecting it in the leaſt manner by vertue of his obedience; and truly this is the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of a Chriſtian ſoule, whereas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother man, if he have kept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and performed the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he then looketh for acceptance from God; as if the Lord make this Promiſe, that <hi>He that confeſſeth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh his ſin, ſhall find mercy:</hi> This man
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105680:85"/> confeſſeth his ſin unto God, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it, and therefore he looketh for mercy: But this is not the manner of Gods people, and yet if they look for any mercy, it is in the way of God, but not for their owne goodnes, their hope is in the faithfulneſſe and free-grace of God; they may make mention to the praiſe of God, how he hath guided them, and carryed them an end in his owne wayes, yet they chalenge nothing for any thing that they have done, but put the Lord in mind of his free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; that as of his free grace he hath freely promiſed, ſo from the ſame grace he may make good what he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>

                  <p>So that the children of the Covenant of grace will onely tell you, that they are free from the Covenant of the Law, but not from the Commandment of it: for as it is given by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in the Goſpell, and as Chriſt hath given us his Spirit, enabling us to keep

Therefore we

There may be a change in the ſoule, which may ſpring from a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage, and may captivate our conſciences unto the Law, that may reſtraine us from ſin, and conſtraine us unto duty: but ſuch holineſſe ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not alwayes from our union with Chriſt, for there may be a conſcience of duty without ſenſe of our need of Chriſt; as it was with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> Deut. 5.27,28,29. <hi>Goe thou neer</hi> (ſay they to <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>and hear

Truſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any of theſe, but let all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence be in Jeſus Chriſt, not in any
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105680:94"/> of the gifts of his Spirit whatſoever. For a little further opening of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Truſt not in any gifts that you have received for the performance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duty; for it is not the ſtrongeſt Chriſtian that is able to put forth a good thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. but our ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is of God, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cannot onely not doe any great matter by his owne ſtrength and grace, but nothing at all without Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore he giveth us to underſtand, that it is God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in us both to will and to do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. If therefore we have any new work to doe, look to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt afreſh by Faith, that he may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an end all our works in us and for us; otherwiſe it is not any ſtrength or grace in us, that can produce any good work, word, or thought; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (mind you) the Apoſtle maketh it a principle of Chriſtian Religion, that the juſt man <hi>liveth by faith,</hi> and he often mentioneth it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>The life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God;</hi> where he putteth it into his owne experience: Why, did not he live by love, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:105680:95"/> and zeale? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yes, truly they were lively in him, if ever in any man, beſides our bleſſed Saviour: and yet notwithſtanding he never attributeth life to any of theſe gifts of his, but if he ſpeak of life, he maketh this his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall life, <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God;</hi> and <hi>I am able to doe all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phi. 4.13. This is the true ſavour of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpirit, that when gifts are at the higheſt, the heart is then at the loweſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9,10. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> there acknowledgeth himſelfe to be as one born out of due time; for (ſaith he) <hi>I am leſſe than the leaſt of the Apoſtles, not meet to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Church of God; yea but by the grace of God I am what I am and his grace, which was beſtowed on me, was not in vaine, but I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God in me.</hi> This is truly ſpirituall ſanctification, that when the ſoule is full of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, yet he is like a man in great penury, as having nothing of himſelfe, this is a marvelous ſpirituall poverty, and you ſhall ever find (and I deſire the Lord
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105680:95"/> would open the hearts of his people to know what I ſpeak) that if Chriſtians have fallen, their greateſt falls have been in their moſt eminent and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary gifts. If you ſhall mark the ſins of all the ſervants of God, they have been chiefly found in the very exerciſe of their beſt gifts; let us take a little taſt of them, that we may learn to uſe our gifts in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Abraham</hi> a man full of Faith, none went beyond him in the old nor new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet if you read of any failing in him, it is in regard of the acting of Faith: what made him afraid not once but the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> time, that his wife would be taken from him by <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> Gen. 12. by <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Chap. 20. had not the Lord promiſed to bleſſe him whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he came, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.2. He had ſo much of the knowledge and grace of God ſhining in him, that <hi>Sarah</hi> needed not to have diſſembled, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> (a poor Heathen) could ſay as much, Chap. 20.16. <hi>Behold thy Husband is to thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus ſhe was reproved:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt no ſhifts and lyes for thy protection,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105680:96"/> and to be a vayle unto thee. This a poor Heathen can diſcern, that a man that hath God with him, needeth no other ſhifts nor covering to defend and ſhelter him. Thus we ſee that theſe great failings of <hi>Abraham</hi> were proper acts of unbeliefe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> a meek man, none like him for meekneſſe on the face of the earth, there is but one ſin ſtoried of him after he came to the Government of that ſtate, and this was his failing, <hi>Heare now you Rebells, muſt we fetch you water out of this rock?</hi> ſo he lift up his hand, &amp; with his rod he ſmote the rock twice, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.10,11. They provoked <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> as meek as he was; ſometimes when <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> dealt as peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, he was not moved from the meekneſſe of his ſpirit: But now he falleth into paſſion, and this was the very ſin for which the Lord excluded him out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Numb. 27.12,13,14. it was the breach of this royall grace, Chap. 20.12. <hi>Becauſe ye believed me not, to ſanctifie me in the eyes of the Children of Iſrael, therefore you ſhall not bring this Congregation into the Land which I have given them.</hi> Which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:105680:96"/> words ſhew us the reaſon of his failing in the grace wherein he ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, <hi>Becauſe yee believed me not.</hi> The Lord will have him know, that he muſt live by his Faith in his <hi>meekneſſe;</hi> if any man think himſelfe to be a meek man, and nothing ſhall over-wraſtle him there, if you believe not in God, but in your meekneſſe, your confidence will ſoon faile you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter.</hi> a man full of courage, and you read of two of his principall failings, and both in point of courage; he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the high Prieſts hall at the voyce of a damſell; and in the porch at the ſpeech of another maid, and the third time, at the voyce of one that ſtood by. <hi>Math.</hi> 26.69. &amp;c. Whereas afterwards, when he lived by faith, he became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted before the whole Councell, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.13. Another failing of his in point of courage we read of <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>He feared thoſe of the Circumciſion;</hi> whereas before he did eat with the Gentiles &amp;c. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> eminent gifts, did not bring forth their fruits. Know therefore that the beſt of all your gifts, <hi>faith, courage, meeknes, wiſdome, love to your brethren,</hi> will faile,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105680:97"/> if you truſt in them, and you will be moſt apt to faile there wherein you do moſt excell.</p>
                  <p>If a man be wiſe, he ſhall faile in that point, and it may be in nothing ſo much as in that, even in thoſe things wherein he thinketh he walketh moſt wiſely; and ſuch an one will find moſt tryalls in point of his wiſedome, and the like will be found in all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all to this end, to teach the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> of God to know that no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth by his wiſdome, nor by any thing in himſelfe, but by Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whom God hath given unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and who is onely able to give new ſupplyes of his ſpirit unto his ſervants, to act every gift which he hath given them.</p>
                  <p>I might have mentioned the example of <hi>Sarah,</hi> a meek and a quiet godly ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited woman, ſubject and obedient to her Husband, and called him <hi>Lord, whoſe daughters you are while you doe well,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.6. and yet you know, one of her greateſt failings was in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to her Husband, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.5. <hi>When ſhe ſaw that ſhe was deſpiſed, ſhe ſaid to her Husband, Thou doſt me wrong,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:105680:97"/> Where is the reverence of <hi>Sarah</hi> now? Will you have the daughters of <hi>Sarah</hi> to imitate her herein? What had her Husband done? There was no fault in him in this matter, ſhe had no reaſon to tax him upon this point, it was her owne Counſel, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. that he ſhould goe in to her maid, <hi>that I may have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by her;</hi> therefore there was no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of any juſt complaint on her part, yet ſee this meek ſpirited woman fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the point of her meekneſſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and did expreſſe no greater failing all her life long, that we read of; ſhe was weak in Faith once, but there was great reaſon for that, her womb was dead, and her <hi>Lord</hi> (as ſhe called him) was old alſo: Nor doth the Angel ſo much blame her about it, but that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein ſhe moſt failed, was in that grace wherein ſhe moſt abounded. And though every grace of the Spirit be of great force when the Lord doth act and move it, yet let a man goe forth in the ſtrength of his greateſt gifts, and if ever his heart faile him, it will be in them. Thinke not when you have done all you can, that you are worthy of any thing, but ſay that you are unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105680:98"/> ſervants: For though ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be the way wherein the Lord will poure out all his bleſſings upon his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yet he doth require them to boaſt in none of their excellencies, but look at them all, as freely given them of God; and conſider, that the right unto all, ſpringeth from fellowſhip with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that ſo not onely the gift it ſelfe is grace, but the bleſſing that followeth upon the gift is grace alſo; and ſuppoſe that we have attained all that we pray for, ſhall we then exalt our owne gifts? No, but let us ſay with <hi>Jacob, I am leſſe than the leaſt of all the mercies and truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doe not truſt, as not upon gifts, nor upon duties performed by thoſe gifts, to reach the bleſſing; ſo look not for your <hi>Juſtification</hi> from thence at all; for the Apoſtle is plaine, that he looked not for any thing for his righteouſneſs before his converſion; and after his converſion, he <hi>counteth it all as droſſe and dung, that he might win Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.6,7,8. And, for our <hi>faith,</hi> they are not to be truſted upon as grounds of our Faith; for all the gifts of our ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105680:98"/> are fruits of our Faith; and therefore our Faith is ſaid <hi>to worke by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. and ſo it doth by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gifts of the Spirit, and if they be fruits of Faith, then Faith is not built upon them.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the ſecond Uſe which Chriſtians are to make of their Sanctification.</p>

                     <label>3</label> There is in the next place a point of <hi>Witneſſe,</hi> which this Sanctification doth yield, and the Spirit of God with it; the <hi>water</hi> beareth witneſſe to the <hi>blood,</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> to the <hi>water,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> unto both, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.6,7,8. A mans owne Spirit beareth witneſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. And therefore as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God unto our Faith, we may lawfully hear what it ſpeaketh: But this is the life of a true Evidence, that all theſe gifts of God doe not bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe any further then a man ſeeth the Lord Jeſus working them in him, and for him; for it is Faith that maketh all the graces of the Goſpel active; and it is a condition ſo requiſite, that unleſſe our works be of Faith, and flow from it, they are not acceptable before God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Therefore unleſſe Faith car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105680:99"/> an end our works, they are not works of holineſſe, ſuch as ſhould bear witneſſe to the ſoule; therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth ſtir up the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto this mainly, <hi>Examine your ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are in the faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. And if he doe exhort them to Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it is in point of Faith, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Reverend <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> (who hath written a Sermon upon that Text) ſaith well, <hi>That unleſſe men find faith in their holineſſe, none of all their ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification will become a ſound witneſſe of the grace of God unto them;</hi> but if Faith be found, then you ſhall ſee Jeſus Chriſt accepting you, and breathing in you, except ye be reprobates.</p>
                  <p>There is a marvelous gratious wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that Sanctification giveth unto him that liveth by Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> if it be in Chriſt, and work from him, and for him. This onely is that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication which the <hi>Lord</hi> commendeth unto his ſervants to ſeek after it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>4</label> A fourth Uſe of our ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that the Spirit of God helpeth us by it in point of <hi>Rejoycing;</hi> and therefore it is that you ſhall ſee the Servants of God rejoycing in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:105680:99"/> ſo doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. — <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our conſcience,</hi> &amp;c. He rejoyceth at what the Lord doth by him, and with him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. But what is it that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Apoſtle rejoyce before God? When he rejoyceth in his work before the Lord, you ſhall ever find him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing at the Lords acting theſe gifts in him, and bleſſing him in his work. Let us look upon two or three Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for this end, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12,13. So that (mind you) as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eeth God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him theſe gifts, and enabling him unto the work, ſo he bleſſeth God in that behalfe. You ſhall find him alſo bleſſing God that had proſpered this worke of the Miniſtry whereſoever he came, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The Lord working in him and for him, maketh him to triumph and to over-wraſtle all the difficulties that he meeteth withall. The Lord had given him gifts, &amp; taught him to exerciſe thoſe gifts, and doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him, and therefore he expreſſeth himſelfe in a marvelous ſtrong ſpeech, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20,21. <hi>I am in nothing aſhamed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for to me to live is Chriſt, and to dye is gaine. To me to live is Chriſt;</hi> as if he had
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105680:100"/> ſaid, I have no life but from Chriſt, I put forth no act of life but for Chriſt; this is the ſum of all his converſation; and if Chriſt be his life, then death will be his advantage, and Chriſt will be magnified in either.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee how the Saints of God have made uſe of their Sanctification; they are carefull to ſee that it flow from Chriſt, and yet when they have it they dare not truſt in their beſt gifts for the leaſt duty, neither doe they look for their Faith from their beſt gifts, but they expect their beſt gifts to flow from their Faith: They make uſe of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of their holineſſe when they ſee Chriſt in it, and Faith in it, and the Spirit of God carrying them along in the ways and duties thereof. Thus they ſee their holineſſe, and take comfort in it, &amp; from the witneſſe of it, as that by which the Lord diſpenſeth comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people, when they receive it from the hands of Chriſt, &amp; by Faith in him, by which they are taught of God to carry an end their whole converſation in his name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>5</label> Furthermore, as we receive it from Chriſt, and truſt not in it, but in Chriſt,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:105680:100"/> and receive the witneſſe of it in Chriſt, and in the Holy Spirit of Chriſt; and as we receive joy and comfort alſo which the Lord doth miniſter to us in a Sanctified courſe by his Holy Spirit, ſo we grow up and perfect our holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which we have received in his name.</p>
                  <p>There is growth in grace, this San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is not bedrid, Chriſtians are not as weak now, as they were ſeven years agoe, nor doe they ſtand at a ſtay, but goe forward in Chriſtianity; and hereupon the Apoſtle exhorteth the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi> Chap. 4.16. <hi>To ſpeak the truth in love, that they may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Chriſt:</hi> Implying, that men that enter into the wayes of holineſſe, ought to grow on unto perfection in the fear of God, <hi>Job</hi> 17.9. And many ſweet meanes the Lord hath appointed for this end; the communion of Gods people tendeth hereto, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhall learn wiſedome:</hi> All the Ordinances of God are appointed for this end alſo, to beget and encreaſe Faith and holineſſe; therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in the uſe of all theſe Ordinances,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:105680:101"/> doth not ſtand at a ſtay, but is ſtill thriving and growing, and that not in his owne ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſeeking for his accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and help in every duty he goeth about; and this is that the Apoſtle doth exhort the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> unto, Chap. 2.6,7. This ought Chriſtians mainly to attend unto, that as you ſee the branch, the more juice it ſucketh, the more fruitfull it is; ſo alſo it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the people of God to know, that the more need we ſtand in to be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the more need we have to derive a continuall freſh ſupply from the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that by his Spirit renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace in us, we may be enlarged, and carried an end in the wayes of God; whereas otherwiſe, the hearts of Chriſtians would ſoon faile to goe on in thoſe things wherein they deſire to be growing up unto perfection.</p>
                  <p>What is the reaſon that ſo many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God are not ſo lively in their profeſſion as they were wont to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares agoe? Truly wee attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ordinances, but it is onely upon the outward act of them, and not upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in them; this is many times
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105680:101"/> wanting in the hearts of Gods people; but truly if this be our conſtant frame, and wee doe not recover our ſelves, then is not our ſanctification ſuch as floweth from fellowſhip with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for you ſhall finde this to be true, that there is no gift of Chriſt, nor no ſanctification accompanying ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it doth knit us neerer and neerer unto Chriſt; and the more wee are filled with true ſpirituall gifts, the more empty wee are of our owne ſtrength, and ſelfe conceits; and ſo wee ought to be, otherwiſe we ſhall conſtantly finde this, that if the Lord doe not preſerve this empty frame in us, the more full we are of any gift, the more full ſhall we be of our owne ſtrength, and conſequently the leſſe need ſhall we feele of Chriſt; and if this be our conſtant frame, it will be a ſad argument that our beſt ſanctification will not endure but fall away, unleſſe we be knit unto Chriſt by the Spirit of his grace; for by all true ſanctification we are the more knit unto him, ſo that if any man would know whether the ſuperſcription of Chriſt and his Image be ſtamped upon his ſanctification, this
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:105680:102"/> you ſhall ever finde to be the ſtampe of the grace of Chriſt, that the more you receive from him, the more you ſtand in need of him; in ſo much that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the gifts of the Spirit, there is not the ableſt Miniſter of the New Teſtament, but (if his gifts flow from the Spirit of Chriſt, and knit you unto Chriſt) you will finde as great need to cleave unto Chriſt, as ever you did the firſt day when you came trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling into the Pulpit. If therefore wee feele our ſelves full, ſo that the more we have received, the more ſufficient we are, and goe not about the duties we have in hand in feare &amp; trembling, but in ſelfe-confidence, if this be our uſuall and conſtant practiſe, it is but counterfeit Chriſtianity; I doe not ſay that the gifts are counterfeit, for they are from the Spirit of God, and men may by them be very ſerviceable to Church and Common-weale, but this is certaine, that the ſtronger and the more your gifts are, if you ſit looſe from Chriſt, the emptier your hearts are of him. But you will ſay, may not a Chriſtian be full of himſelfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſtrength of his owne
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:105680:102"/> gifts? Yes, God forbid I ſhould deny that, for the beſt Chriſtians have gone aſtray in the exerciſe of their beſt gifts; and hereupon <hi>Abraham</hi> hath been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in faith, <hi>Moſes</hi> in meeknes, <hi>Peter</hi> in courage, and <hi>Sarah</hi> in her modeſty, they have been ſo apt to truſt upon thoſe graces of God, wherein they have moſt abounded, that they have principally failed therein: but this you ſhall finde, that (if they have been overtaken once or twice) as the burnt childe dreads the fire, ſo they grow to be more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their need of Chriſt, more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of departing from him, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to cleave unto him, that they might grow up in his Name unto all well pleaſing in his ſight. If therefore there be a ſanctification that ſtandeth at a ſtay in any man, it is a great ſuſpition whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gifts thereof flow from fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or no; if gifts be truly ſpirituall, a man ſhall uſually grow up in them, <hi>Habenti dabitur.</hi> Imploy them, and multiply them; but if you imploy the gifts you have received, in your owne ſtrength, and you are now full of your owne ſanctification, truly this is but frothy work, and doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:105680:103"/> true nor lively nouriſhment and comfort: but the comfort and life is to him that in his moſt ſpirituall gifts &amp; beſt performances, is empty of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and onely full of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to live or dye is his advantage.</p>
                  <p>This is the Uſe which I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you touching your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſanctification. Thus we ſee ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things have been cleered from this doctrine concerning the Covenant of grace. There remaineth another thing to be reſolved and cleered from the doctrine; for if God in the Covenant of his grace doe give himſelfe to be <hi>a God</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his ſeede, It is then to be enquired, How God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth himſelfe, and how the Son, and how the holy Ghoſt giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for theſe are the fundamentalls of the Covenant of grace, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be opened for cleering the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Queſt.</label> How God the <hi>Father</hi> doth give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be a God in Covenant to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and to his ſeed, that is, to the faithfull ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> All the Perſons in Trinity concurre in works <hi>ad extra,</hi> in works upon the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:105680:103"/> Creature. They give themſelves by a Threefold worke or Act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>1.</label> The firſt Act of God is (having choſen us in his Sonne) He gave forth his owne Sonne out of his boſome for the redemption of <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; his ſeed; that is the firſt and fundamentall of all the reſt that God doth put forth, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Perſon in Trinity, for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the Covenant unto the hearts of his people; And God in giving his Sonne doth give himſelfe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30. &amp; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. And as God giveth us his Sonne, ſo <hi>he giveth us all things elſe in his Sonne,</hi> Rom. 8.32. So then this is the firſt and the great worke of God, that he hath given his Son out of his own boſome, to take our nature upon him, to lead a miſerable life, and to dye a curſed death, and in him hath given all his Attributes, his mercy, and power unto the ſonnes of men; an undoubted ſigne that God intendeth to give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the Covenant of grace unto his people, when he giveth Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe in that Covenant, as he doth expreſſely, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.6. where wee may ſee that God giveth another, even that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:105680:104"/> God the Father giveth God the Sonne. Thus it is a gift of the Covenant that God giveth his Sonne to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Covenant, and the chiefe bleſſing of it. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 49.8. He ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>No man hath ſeene God at any time,</hi> (Joh. 1.18.) nor can ſee him; nor will God the Father have immediate fellowſhip with any creature; but the onely begotten Sonne of the Father, the Lord hath given him that he might reveale him; Thus wee may perceive that the Lord is gratious and marvellous gratious in that he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us his Sonne, his deare Sonne, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity; and thus he ſaith to his Elect; <hi>I will be a God unto thee, and give thee my Sonne that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thee out of all diſtreſſe and danger.</hi> Thus doth the Lord for his people, and it is a cleere evidence of his grace, and ſheweth that his love unto his people is beyond all banks and bottome; for the Lord to give us his Sonne, and this Sonne ſo ſoone as he was promiſed, his people ſaw him a farre of. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.56. <hi>Your father Abraham rejoyced to ſee my day, and he ſaw it, and was glad.</hi> For when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was promiſed unto
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:105680:104"/> him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.16,17. and the Lord had ſaid unto him, I will bleſſe <hi>Sarah</hi> and give thee a ſonne of her, yea I will bleſſe her, &amp;c. Then <hi>Abraham</hi> fell upon his face and laughed; he did rejoyce that the Lord would give him a Saviour out of his loynes: how it could be brought to paſſe it may be he knew not, but by a ſpirit of Prophecy did he diſcerne it no doubt. This is the firſt worke of God in giving himſelfe by Covenant, and this was done long agoe before we were borne; he gave him in his eternall counſell when he did elect us in him: he gave him when he ſent him into the world. But this is more when</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>2.</label> He giveth us <hi>unto</hi> his Chriſt <hi>by Covenant,</hi> and draweth us unto him, and <hi>giveth Chriſt unto us alſo.</hi> And this grace of God cometh neerer us; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did leave us like lambs in a large paſture, but now as He giveth us unto Chriſt, ſo he giveth him unto us, and both in preſent poſſeſſion. And this the Father doth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. for <hi>no man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him; and every one that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi> Now this
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:105680:105"/> kinde of hearing and learning of the Father, is a ſtrange kinde of learning which the Lord Teacheth the ſoule by — when he draweth him unto Chriſt, an effectuall Teaching and powerfull. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. This is your <hi>effectuall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;</hi> and this is the Lords giving us unto his Sonne, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. All this is properly the worke of the Father. Men are ſaid to be well given when they give themſelves to their bookes, to their works, and buſineſſe, but this we may well ſay, that we are indeed well given when the Lord giveth us unto his Sonne; for otherwiſe we are but in all ill ſtate, which way ſoever we are given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Queſt.</label> If you ſhall aske, How the Father giveth us, and calleth us, and draweth us into fellowſhip with his Sonne? (for they are Scripture-phraſes, and all of them of like value in Scripture-ſenſe.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <label>Anſw.</label> In a word, The Lord draweth us unto his Sonne by his Spirit, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, us as by his word, ſo by his Spirit alſo, and giveth us by his word and Spirit unto Jeſus Chriſt. In this thing I ſhall ſpeake no more unto you, than
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:105680:105"/> what you have often heard, and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe long agoe received; As that the Lord calleth his people out of their ſinnes by the light of the Law, and by the Spirit of <hi>bondage;</hi> he ſetteth home the Law effectually unto the ſoule, and thereby draweth us from ſin and from the world in ſome meaſure, that we have now no minde to thoſe things which before we were full of delight in, whether they be ſinnes againſt the Law, or ſinnes againſt the Goſpell: it is the Lords uſuall dealing by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to ſet home ſinnes againſt both in ſo much that thereby we come to be afflicted with ſome kinde of trembling and feare and torment about our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eſtate. And thus it was with <hi>Saul</hi> (who afterwards was <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>Acts</hi> 9.3,4,5,6. when Chriſt called unto him out of heaven, and challenged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him of ſinne, he all trembling and aſtoniſhed ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> So it was with the <hi>Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> Acts 16.29. After the Lord had ſhaken his heart with an earth-quake (which is a ſanction of the Law, and a ratification of it, as all Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are) he called for a light, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:105680:106"/> ſprang in, <hi>and came trembling to Paul and Silas.</hi> Thus the Lord draweth men out of themſelves, and their finfull wayes by a ſpirit of bondage, whereby they are convinced of ſinne, and deſert of Gods wrath, are greatly and deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with feare: concerning which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of feare</hi> (or bondage) <hi>but of power, of love, and of a ſound mind,</hi> &amp;c. Such feare alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. when he ſaith, <hi>Perfect love caſteth out feare, for feare hath torment;</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the ſenſe of a mans eſtate; whereby he is forced to cry out many times, and to ſay, woe worth my ſoule, that ever I was borne, for the Lord cauſeth the to poſſeſſe all my ſinnes, and preſſeth me downe to the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hell. This is one worke of the Spirit of bondage, by which the Lord draweth the ſoule out of it ſelfe and ſinnes, though of it ſelfe the ſpirit of feare goeth no further than to ſhake a mans carnall confidence; which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed with Anguiſh and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.10.</p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:105680:106"/>
                  <p>Beſides this Spirit of Bondage, the Lord hath another work, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Spirit of <hi>Burning,</hi> Mal 4.1. <hi>The day cometh,</hi> &amp;c. This is a Spirit of <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> let us ſpeak unto it a little; the Prophet ſaith, <hi>I ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi> There are two things in the root.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is the <hi>Roote of Abrahams Covenant,</hi> which this people much tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon; and that is it of which <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Now the axe is layd to the roote of the Tree,</hi> &amp;c. and this he ſpake (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9.) after he had ſaid, <hi>Thinke not to ſay within your your ſelves, Wee have Abraham to our father,</hi> verſ. 8. So that all the confidence that they had in <hi>Abrahams Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and ſuch things, is burnt up, and ſo they have no roote left them to ſtand upon. And this is one thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>Roote.</hi> But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, there is ſomething more in it, for with this Spirit of <hi>burning,</hi> the Lord by the power of this Spirit doth cut us off from any power of our owne naturall gifts, and parts, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts alſo, whereby we thought to lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt; and we are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:105680:107"/> cut off hereby from all the confidences that we have in our owne ſufficiency; when once the Lord intendeth to bring a ſoule unto himſelfe; for there is an uſuall pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idence that we have in our owne ſtate, though the Lord have cut us off from hope in the righteouſneſſe of our parents, and from boaſting of his Ordinances, yet we thinke there is ſome power ſtill left us, and therefore we hope and will ſeeke in our owne ſtrength, that the Lord may reveale himſelfe to us in mercy and peace; but when the Lord cometh neerer unto us, he will ſhew us how unable we are to take up the leaſt good reſolution, we ſhall finde our ſelves, like bruiſed reeds unable to hold up our heads; for Chriſt came to ſeeke and to ſave that which was <hi>loſt,</hi> ſo that Chriſt will not declare himſelfe to ſeeke us untill we be loſt, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelfe, and follow me;</hi> And according hereunto it is that thoſe converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. doe cry out when they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall wee doe?</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:105680:107"/> Hence it is alſo that the poore ſoules that came unto Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.20. were like bruiſed reeds that could not hold up their heads, for the Lord in this caſe bruiſeth them, &amp; layeth them low, that they ſee no more hope of mercy, nor likelihood that God ſhould ſhew them any hope. Thus doth the Lord <hi>burne</hi> up the <hi>Root of Abrahams Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> wherein men truſt, and the <hi>Roote of all our ſelfe-ſufficiency,</hi> that now wee find our ſelves dryed up &amp; our ſtrength conſumed, that now we are not able to thinke as of our ſelves a good thought.</p>
                  <p>And againe the Lord by this ſpirit of burning doth burne up all our <hi>branches</hi> alſo, how faire and greene ſoever they have been; All our faſtings, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, and almſdeeds, and prayers, ſuch things as the Phariſees much boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.1,2,3. &amp;c. but theſe things are all burnt up. The fruit of bondage worketh unto feare, and now all the hope is that a man ſetteth upon reformation; but if the Lord love a mans ſoule, he will not let him ſtay there, but goeth further with him, and ſheweth him that his prayers and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:105680:108"/> are all empty and fall ſhort of the life and power of Jeſus Chriſt; but yet the ſoule is not quite out of hope, though the Law cannot ſave me, if it cannot, I muſt get me unto Jeſus Chriſt, and lay hold upon him for ſalvation; as if all were to be had by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, if once we can lay hold upon him, and nothing elſe were required but faith in Chriſt, and thereby my lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon him: I ſee plainly (ſaith a man in this caſe) that there is no hope in me, as hath been rightly obſerved, and therefore Ile truſt upon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and give up my ſelfe to him: but now if the Lord love thy ſoule, he will not ſuffer thee there to reſt, he will not leave thee ſo, He will preſſe thee further. How comeſt thou by faith in Chriſt? Why, thou tookeſt it up of thine owne accord, thou thoughteſt all thy gifts a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d duties were in vaine, and therefore now thou wilt believe in Jeſus Chriſt: Is it ſo eaſie a matter? Can any man come unto Chriſt except the Father draw him? And is thy faith any more than a reſolution of thine owne, when thou waſt convinced of the emptineſſe of thine owne gifts and abilities?
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:105680:108"/> When this ſpirit of burning hath bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted this thy faith alſo, and that by the cleere evidence of the Goſpel put upon it. Now ſaith the ſoule, I ſee that I am not in Chriſt, though I ſaid that I would truſt in Chriſt, yet I ſee, it is not every one that ſaith, <hi>Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heaven.</hi> Now I ſee it is not my faith (ſuch a Faith as mine is) that will reach Jeſus Chriſt; it is not a faith of my own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking that will ſerve the turne. I ſee now Chriſt alone muſt worke this great worke in me, and Chriſt in the way of his owne Ordinances, therefore I muſt looke for it in his word, and in the fellowſhip of the Sacraments; therefore I will look up unto the Lord in all theſe, and waite for him, and ſeek him therein: And I hope I can ſeeke and waite in that way, though I can do nothing elſe, and ſo the poore ſoule maketh account that in time he ſhall finde Chriſt in the Ordinances, and ſo hammereth out a faith from thence, and therein bleſſeth himſelfe. Now (minde you) the Spirit of God (when the Lord God the Father will draw home the ſoule throughly to Jeſus
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:105680:109"/> Chriſt) will burne up all thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for if thy ſoule be not utterly loſt, ſo long as it hath any roote, or power in it ſelfe, it is not come to an utter ſelfe-deniall; though I cannot worke I will believe, and if I cannot believe, I can waite that I may believe, and ſo here is ſtill the old roote of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> left alive in us, whereby men ſeeke to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe. This old roote putteth forth it ſelfe, and will not ſuffer the ſoule to be wholly <hi>from</hi> Chriſt and <hi>for</hi> Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and all becauſe there is a ſprigge of <hi>Adam</hi> left in the ſoule; whence it is, that the ſoule is marvellouſly apt to have hope and confidence more or leſſe from ſome vertue or power in himſelfe, therefore its no ſmall matter to be cut off from <hi>Adam;</hi> thats contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; As ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.24. this is a marvellous ſtrong work, when the Spirit of God comes to act things contrary to nature; for nature is fully poſſeſſed, that what God commandeth, I am able to doe it: nature will not be perſwaded to the contrary; If I heare God command any thing, I will doe it (ſaith a carnall heart) and if I cannot
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105680:109"/> do it, I will believe, and if I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I will waite, and I can waite that I may believe; this is ſtill but nature: Now when the Lord cometh indeed to ingraffe us into Jeſus Chriſt, this is quite contrary to nature. Why, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is it ſo contrary? I anſwer, whereas nature is active for it ſelfe, now it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that whereas a ſoul hath been ſtirring and buſie in his owne ſtrength, at length the Spirit of God, by the mighty power of his grace, being ſhed abroad into the ſoule, doth burn up root and branch, not onely the root of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Covenant, but all the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the root of the <hi>Wild Olive,</hi> by which we are fat and lively to all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall work in our owne apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that we work in our owne ſtrength, untill the Lord come and cut us quite down, and make us to ſee that there is not the leaſt good thought, as of our ſelves, and therefore unleſſe the Lord be wonderfully gratious unto us, we cannot be ſaved, till it come unto this, the ſoule is not fit for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Spirit of God may worke powerfully in the hearts of men, and burn up their root and branch, and this
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:105680:110"/> a ſpirit of burning may doe, and yet leave the ſoule in a damnable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ought I know, and ſuch as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſoule may be in, and yet never come to enjoy ſaving fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt; therefore as this is one arm of God ſtretched forth for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his people, when he draweth them out of themſelves, by a Spirit Of

                     </list> towards Chriſt: So</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is a further work of God in drawing us home throughly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to Jeſus Chriſt, when he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Spirit of Adoption, which reacheth beyond all the former work; he hath cut us off from our ſelves, and now we ſtand in a ſtate quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to nature, and if any ſaving work be wrought in us, it is quite contrary to nature; if any thing fall upon the heart and ſoule of a man, to bring his will to this paſſe, to lye downe at Gods feet, that he knoweth not what to doe, and yet whatſoever the Lord calleth him unto, he is willing, if it were poſſible to be done, he would run through fire and water to doe it: but he findeth himſelfe unable to doe any
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:105680:110"/> thing, and now he will tell you that <hi>to believe</hi> is as impoſſible for him as to build a world: why then bid him wait, waite? ſaith he, I, but I cannot waite, and if I ſeek the Lord, I cannot find him, and I ſee others of Gods ſervants wrought upon gratiouſly, but dead-hearted I, nothing will work upon me; now in ſuch a caſe as this, the Spirit of God cometh into the heart of a Chriſtian, and taketh poſſeſſion of the ſoule for Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo draweth the ſoule to Chriſt, and maketh it there to ſtay, and there to lye down, and to be willing to be drawne yet neerer and neerer unto Chriſt, and to be carried an end by him, to take all from him, &amp; to give all the glory to him. This Spirit of Adoption doth give a man a Son-like frame to lye proſtrate at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, like unto the Prodigall Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17,18,19. who when he came to himſelfe, and ſaw how unable he was to provide for himſelfe, and how unworthy he was that his Father ſhould doe any thing for him, he came and lay downe at the feet of his Father, for he is unable and unworthy of any mercy. Now this ſtooping of the heart
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:105680:111"/> unto God, and yielding unto him to doe with us as ſeemeth good in his own eyes, is ſuch a proſtration of the heart, wherein the Lord hath taken poſſeſſion of the ſoule, that now a man is led un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fellowſhip with Chriſt, that there is <hi>None in Heaven but him, none in the earth in compariſon of him that the ſoule deſireth after;</hi> and now a man waiteth upon Chriſt to ſee what he will doe for him; and though he cannot tell you that he waiteth, yet he doth waite, that he may be helped of God, to depend upon him. Thus he receiveth all from Chriſt, and giveth all unto him. This is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drawing of the ſoule, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be <hi>the hearing and learning of the Father,</hi> of which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>ch.</hi> 6.45. <hi>He that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me;</hi> which is, when the Lord hath drawne the ſoule out of his naturall corruptions, legall reformations, pretences of Faith, and waiting upon Chriſt in his owne ſtrength for Faith, if it be wanting: Then when the ſoul doth lie at his feet to be diſpoſed of according to the will of God, and is in ſome meaſure ſubject unto the Lord, though not ſo much as
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:105680:111"/> he could deſire; and therefore now the ſoule doth not content or bleſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in any gifts or works of his own, but yieldeth himſelfe humbly to the Lord, to work in him both will and deed of his owne good pleaſure, and to teach him how to ſeek, and waite, and believe, and long after Jeſus Chriſt, theſe things he waiteth for: Otherwiſe untill he be thus taught of God, the ſoule will alwayes think that he can doe ſomething; and is not able to come out of himſelf to utter denyall of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; but if any man will come unto Chriſt, he muſt deny himſelfe, even all his owne gifts, and parts, and good works whatſoever; for a man is never utterly denyed, untill there be nothing left of which a man can ſay, This I am able to doe, or this is an hopefull thing in me; and when it cometh to this paſſe, then will the ſoule lie down at the will of God, and acknowledge, that if the Lord would never ſhew him mercy, juſt and righteous are his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now when the ſoule and will of a Chriſtian are convinced of theſe things, as well as his judgement, that now he waiteth upon Chriſt as well
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:105680:112"/> that he may be able to waite and ſeek the Lord, as he doth for any other good thing from the Lord, he waiteth now upon the Lord for a poor ſpirit, and cannot perke up himſelfe, no more then a bruiſed Reed can doe. Thus when it cometh unto ſaving work, the will and ſoule of a man is ſo caſt downe, that a man cannot tell what to make of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but there he lieth to ſee what the Lord will doe with him, whether he will reach forth the hand of ſalvation unto him or no. In this caſe the ſoule is left utterly void, and hath in himſelf neither root nor branch, but ſeeth how unable he is in himſelfe to beleeve or waite; nor can he tell whether Jeſus Chriſt be his portion, and now doth the Lord take poſſeſſion, and fill the empty ſoule.</p>
                  <p>If you ask me how this ſpirit cometh into the ſoule to make it thus to ſtoop unto Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>You ſhall find that the Lord uſeth to convey himſelfe unto the ſoule in ſome word of Promiſe of the Goſpel that ſheweth unto the ſoule the riches of the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt; ſomething or other is declared of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:105680:112"/> Chriſt. This word being taught in the publick Miniſtry of the word, or brought to remembrance in ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duty, as Prayer, or Conference, or the like, (for I will not limit the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) yet uſually it is done in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; and though the Lord doth not limit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yet he doth limit us to attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the means which he uſually work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by; but whatſoever the way be, this is the manner of Gods working, he doth univerſally come into the ſoul in ſome word or other of his grace; as for inſtance, that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. or that in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. In ſome ſuch word of his grace he cometh and putteth life into the ſoule, and maketh it ſomwhat quies, and cauſeth it to ſee that there is hope in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Lord is able, and there is riches enough in Chriſt to ſave me. By ſuch kind of work it is that the Lord bringeth the ſoules of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants effectually to Chriſt, and now hath God the Father given us unto him, and untill now thou never cameſt unto him ſavingly. This is the ſecond Act whereby God the Father giveth himſelfe unto the ſoule.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:105680:113"/>
                  <p>The third act or work followeth both theſe, as ſoone as ever the Lord hath given this ſelfe-denying ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoule, and hath made it like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bruiſed Reed, or like a Traveller that is out of his way, and willing to take any man by the hand that will lead him into his way againe; when the ſoule is in ſuch a frame, the Lord cometh with a third act of Reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The firſt work was of <hi>Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Proſtration,</hi> the third of <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> This is the third work of the Father, though there is in all theſe works a concurrence of the whole <hi>Trinity,</hi> yet ſome are more proper unto each Perſon, as our Catechiſmes teach us, and we are not wont to ſcruple ſuch expreſſions in them. God the Father created us, and we cannot expound it; but as God the Father created us at the firſt, ſo he doth again create you, or elſe if we acknowledg it in the one, and not in the other, we do wrong unto God, even to the Father. Well, he is then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto us, having given unto us the Spirit of his Son; &amp; now he doth pronounce us reconciled unto him, this is the work which is ſpoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:105680:113"/> and this is the work of God the Father, according to that was before alledged, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world,</hi> &amp;c. Now there are two acts of God as fruits that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hereupon, and both of them done at once upon the ſoule.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The firſt is <hi>Adoption,</hi> whereby he maketh us his Children, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4,5,6. &amp; <hi>John</hi> 1.12. So that now we are the <hi>Brethren</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>Sons</hi> of the Eternall God; <hi>Adoption</hi> is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the work of the Father, but Chriſt being the naturall Son of God, we muſt be knit unto him, before we can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Sons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The ſecond is <hi>Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 8.33,34. This is the Fathers work, and it is principally attributed unto him to forgive our iniquities, and to make reconciliation in Chriſt Jeſus. And look as it is in our naturall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo ſoon as ever we have received naturall life from <hi>Adam,</hi> we become the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and his ſin is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us: ſo it is in the new birth, as ſoon as ever the life of Chriſt is ſhed abroad into our hearts, ſo ſoon are we Heires of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:105680:114"/> of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed unto us now to our Juſtification, as the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> before was to our Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

It will be a help to us for our <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> to Teach us how we came to ſaving fellowſhip with God in Jeſus Chriſt, and wherein lieth our ſpirituall union with Chriſt, and how it is wrought and obtained; and this is neceſſary, for as it hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by others, ſo we may now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it from what we have heard, that there be 4 ſorts of men that fall ſhort of this union with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 You have ſome that bleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their naturall eſtate, it may be they are rich, and honourable among men: well, they bleſſe themſelves in that eſtate, and will never goe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There is another ſort that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the danger of their naturall eſtate, they dare not reſt there, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they fall upon Reformations, and ſo to duties of Humiliation, and ſuch like, wherein they find (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:105680:114"/> ſuch a bleſſed change, and ſo much comfort as doth ſatisfie them: And indeed God doth comfort men in their Reformations, for God will have no man loſe by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2,5. Hypocrices have their reward for their Aime and for their Prayers. <hi>Herod</hi> when he heard <hi>John, reformed many things, and heard him gladly,</hi> Mark 6.20. Here was a great change, and doubtleſſe much comfort in that gladneſſe, yet theſe men never had the work of God the Father, to burn up all that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any ſtrength of their owne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third ſort goe a ſtep beyond theſe, they have been convinced that they went forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Reformation in their owne ſtrength: they plainly ſee it, and diſcerne it, and therefore they know that it is impoſſible to be ſaved by the righteouſneſſe of the Law, and that it is not of works, neither of one kind, nor of another; they are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Faith onely muſt doe the deed, and upon this ground they will take up Faith to believe in Chriſt for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that Faith, which formerly they have pitched upon their good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they will now pitch upon Chriſt;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:105680:115"/> but ſtill it is the ſame Faith, for the root is not yet burnt up, the old corruption ſtill remaineth in them, and ſo here is your old faith ſtill tranſlated from one object to another; it was faſtned before upon your duties and reformations, and now upon Chriſt (though by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ſtrength) and now a man is ready to plead and ſay, If God had not loved me, he would never have ſet me upon ſuch reformations, nor have enlarged me with ſuch comforts, if he had not been well pleaſed with me in Jeſus Chriſt. And though I have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burnt up touching my hope in reformation, yet I have tranſlated my Faith to Jeſus Chriſt; but how came you to doe that? Why, I ſaw my hopes in my owne reformation would not ſerve my turne, and therefore I believed in Jeſus Chriſt, and now ſhall nothing draw me from him, nor pull me from my confidence, for I have built upon ſome word of God, and ſome Promiſe of his made unto ſuch reformation as I have ſet upon, and is not this true Faith in Jeſus Chriſt? This is far from true Faith, it is no other but a ſtrong fallacy whereby the Devil doth cheat
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:105680:115"/> men, and in truth this Faith is but a Faith of a mans owne making (that I may ſo ſpeak) it is no more than a ſpirit of Burning at the beſt, that hath burnt up his confidence in his owne works, and taught him to reſolve in his judgment to believe on Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 There is a fourth ſort alſo that fall far ſhort of Chriſt too, and yet goe beyond all theſe; they goe beyond works, and beyond this Faith alſo w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have ſpoken of, which was not a lively Faith in Chriſt whereby we are juſtified, but men juſtifie themſelves by it, God doth not juſtifie them. Now this fourth ſort come plainly to ſee that their Faith is ſhaken, and they dare not look God in the face, to juſtifie the truth of their Faith before him; it is true, many an heavenly ſpirited man cannot tell what will become of him, nor can he tell whether his Faith be ſound, but many an Hypocrite alſo is ſo far convinced, that he cannot tell what will become of him, nor can he ſay that his Faith is right, nor that he is able to believe: What ſaith the ſoule now in ſuch a caſe as this? He will ſay, I ſee it is not my Reformation, nor
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:105680:116"/> my Faith that will ſerve the turn, what is it then? I ſee that now I muſt <hi>waite</hi> upon Chriſt that I may believe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him I muſt <hi>ſeek</hi> for helpe. Is not this ſoule in a ſtate of everlaſting fellowſhip with Chriſt? Truly this is that which the Lord many times bringeth the ſouls of his Servants unto, but he leaveth them not there, if he mean to doe them good; for I would examine again, how cameſt thou to <hi>waite</hi> upon Jeſus Chriſt? thou haſt been driven out of conceit of thy former Faith, and ſo haſt been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and haſt ſeen a neceſſity to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt for Faith, or elſe thou canſt not believe; force of Argument hath conſtrained thee thus far; if thou haſt taken up a courſe of waiting onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, here is a ſpark of old <hi>Adam</hi> ſtill kept alive in thee: Thou art able to ſeek and wait upon Chriſt, and yet I cannot promiſe thee that thou haſt any part or portion in him. But a ſoule will ſay, <hi>Hath not the Lord made gratious Promiſes to all thoſe that ſeeke for him?</hi> Hath he not ſaid that <hi>all they are bleſſed that waite for him?</hi> Iſa. 30.18. And am not I wrapped up hereby in a bundle of grace and peace? Mind you,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:105680:116"/> there is no promiſe of life made to thoſe that wait &amp; ſeek in their own ſtrength, who being driven to it, have taken it up by their own <hi>reſolutions;</hi> though I grant it is true, that every one that waiteth for, and ſeeketh the Lord aright, is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto it by the Lord, yet if ever the Lord mean to ſave you, he will rend, as it were the caule from the heart, I mean he will pluck away all the confidence you have built upon; a as man would rend the intralls of a Beaſt from him, ſo the Lord will bring you to a flat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of your ſelves, and that you have neither good will nor deed, as of your ſelves: And, you will find, you know not what God will doe with you, but this you know, that whatſoever he doth he is moſt righteous. When the Spirit of God cometh as a Comforter, he will in this manner convince the ſoul of a man that he hath heretofore hung upon his reformations for hope &amp; comfort, but now he is brought plainly to ſee and flatly to deny, that he hath ſo much as one drop of the fatnes of the true Olive tree in him, when he moſt truſted unto his own excellencies. Now a man being thus far brought on, doth not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:105680:117"/> himſelfe in his judgement, but in his will, and is ready to ſay as <hi>David</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did, <hi>If the Lord ſay he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in me, here I am, let him doe unto me as ſeemeth him good.</hi> The Lord is righteous in all that cometh upon me: this onely the ſoul hath for his ſupport in ſuch a caſe, the Lord is able to doe all for me that I ſtand in need of: If he ſhew me no mercy, he is juſt, if he be gratious I ſhall live to praiſe him. Now when a mans will is thus ſubdued, that he hath no will of his owne to be guided by, but onely the will of God; this is true bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe of heart, when not onely the judgement, but the heart and will is broken. The ſoule being thus convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that neither his working, nor believing, nor waiting, nor ſeeking, as of himſelfe, will doe him any good, there is no mercy that he can chalenge for any goodneſſe ſake of his owne; then cometh the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in ſome declaration of Gods free love, and taketh poſſeſſion of the heart, and then the ſoule beginneth to pant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jeſus Chriſt, and nothing in Heaven but him, nor in the Earth beſides him. The ſoule being thus wrought upon, beginneth to put forth it ſelfe towards the Lord Jeſus, but the Holy Ghoſt having taken poſſeſſion before, <hi>helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi> Rom. 8.26,27.

                        <p>Onely if (while the diviſion by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes doe continue) men doe allow and contribute, not onely toward the Poor, but alſo toward the Preaching of the word in their ſeverall Pariſhes,

                        <p>
                           <label>Anſw.</label> The want of a right ſtating of this Queſtion, touching the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates power in matters of Religion, hath occaſioned a world of Errours, tending to infringe the juſt power of the Magiſtrate, we ſhall therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine the termes of the Queſtion, and then confirme it in the Affirmative.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>[Commanding, Forbidding, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing]</hi> we meant the coercive power of the Magiſtrate, which is ſeen in ſuch acts. By <hi>[Matters of Religion command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or forbidden in the word, reſpecting the outward man]</hi> we underſtand indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether thoſe of Doctrine or Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, of faith or practice; his power is not limited to ſuch matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion onely, which are againſt the light of Nature, or againſt the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or againſt the fundamentalls of Religion; all theſe are matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105680:131"/> which may be expreſſed by the outward man, but not onely theſe; therefore we ſay not barely thus <hi>[In matters of the firſt Table]</hi> but joyn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>[In matters of Religion]</hi> that all ambiguity may be avoided, and that it may be underſtood as well of matters which are purely Evangelicall, ſo far as expreſſed by the outward man, at well as of other things. And we ſay, <hi>[Commanded or forbidden in the word]</hi> meaning of the whole word, both of the Old and New Teſtament; excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being onely made of ſuch things which were meerly Ceremoniall, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe peculiar to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> polity, and cleered to be aboliſhed in the New Teſtament: By which limitation of the Magiſtrates power to <hi>things commanded or forbidden in the word,</hi> we exclude any power of the Magiſtrate, either in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding any new thing, whether in doctrine or diſcipline, or any thing in matters of Religion, which is beſide or againſt the word, or in forbidding any thing which is according to the word.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Hence he is not to mould up and impoſe what Eraſtian forme of Church polity he pleaſeth; becauſe if there be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105680:132"/> but one form commanded now of God, he cannot therefore command what forme he will.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Hence he is not to force all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into the Church, or to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the ſeals; becauſe he is not thus commanded.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Hence he is not to limit to things indifferent, which are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor forbidden in the word, without apparent expediency or inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of attending the ſame. By that expreſſion <hi>[cleerly] commanded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the word,</hi> we underſtand that which is cleer, either by expreſs words, or neceſſary Conſequence from the Scripture; and we ſay <hi>cleerly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or forbidden in the word.</hi> Not ſimply that which the Magiſtrate or others think to be cleerly commanded or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; for they may thinke things commanded, to be forbidden, and things forbidden, to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that which is in it ſelfe in ſuch ſort cleer in the word, <hi>de jure,</hi> the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate in theſe days ſince Chriſts aſcenſion, may and ought to command and forbid ſuch things ſo cleared in the word, albeit <hi>de facto,</hi> oft-times he doe

And in this caſe if he inflict a ſlight paper puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when the offence is of an high nature; or contrariwiſe, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts that which is equivalent to a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall puniſhment, when the offence is of an inferiour nature, he doth not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſutably. There are ſundry rules in the word in matters of this ſort, as touching the puniſhment of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Idolatry, Hereſie, prophanation of the Lords day, and ſundry other like matters of Religion, according to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Magiſtrates of old have held, and others now may obſerve proportions, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

The Magiſtrate as a Magiſtrate looketh immediately at the externall acts of the body, and not at the internall acts of the ſoule, its his property as a civill Ruler to attend onely the duties and ſinnes which appeare in the walke of the outward man.

                                 <p>The third Argument is, in that it is recorded as a matter of ſpeciall guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and direction of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>Ezra,</hi> inſpired by the Spirit, as a ſpecial mercy of God to his people, that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> an Heathen King, had an heart to put forth his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive power injoyning things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, and forbidding, with ſanction of ſutable puniſhments, the evils, whether againſt the Lawes of the King, or againſt the Lawes of God, whether concerning Religion, or righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: whence we argue, that this uſe of the civil power was of God of old, and therefore the ſame is as well of God now. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was indeed an inſtrument in the hand of Chriſt, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105680:144"/> not therefore a Type of Chriſt: Nor was this of the nature of a meer Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh judiciall Law, becauſe injoining puniſhments, moral offences being pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable; and yet not therefore of a meer judicial nature, or meerly againſt a judicial Law; beſides this act of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> reſpected civil matters, and matters of the ſecond Table (which none will challenge as not imitable) as well as matters of Religion. And that which ſome object, that he did this for fear of wrath, rather confirmeth the morality of the uſe of ſuch power, then otherwiſe. For what ground of fear in not putting forth ſuch coercive power, if the omiſſion of it were not ſinfull? Yea, if the uſe of ſuch a coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power in matters of Religion, were not according to Gods mind (as our oppoſites ſay) he might rather more groundedly have feared Gods wrath for ſuch an high offence, as uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of a power which the Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, and forbade.</p>

It is the mind of God that civil Rulers in the dayes of the New Teſtament ſhould Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively act in ſpirituall things, which are to the Church as milke; therefore it's his mind that in theſe dayes they ſhould act Authoritatively in matters of Religion, we ſay <hi>to act Authoritatively,</hi> becauſe to act <hi>as Fathers and Mothers,</hi> and therefore not to act meerly alluringly (as ſome ſay) or in a generall way of countenance, but <hi>coercively:</hi> Fathers act fatherly in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, in forbidding, and in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as in kiſſing, and giving good words; in taking the rod, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an Apple; nor doth he ſay, they ſhould be <hi>Nurſes,</hi> as if they were to take upon them to act officially in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or in adminiſtration, whether of Church ſeales, or of Church cenſures.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105680:148"/> The nature of the ſimilitude forbids it.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105680:160"/> the matters agitated in that Synod, appears thus: In every regular diſcharge of the duty of the Church-meſſengers in a Synod where there is a concurrence of ability, right, and duty, to paſſe an actuall judgement, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarative to the truth, there was an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall judgement.</p>
